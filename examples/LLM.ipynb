As settlements become more populous they acquire more complex functions: transportational (e.g. port); economic (e.g. market); administrative (e.g. storehouse, local government building); cultural (e.g. theatre); religious (e.g. temple), utilitarian (e.g. hospital), monumental (e.g. statues, plazas). Example: (1) Large City (monumental structures, theatre, market, hospital, central government buildings) (2) City (market, theatre, regional government buildings) (3) Large Town (market, administrative buildings) (4) Town (administrative buildings, storehouse)) (5) Village (shrine) (6) Hamlet (residential only). In the narrative paragraph explain the different levels and list their functions. Provide a (crude) estimate of population sizes. For example, Large Town (market, temple, administrative buildings): 2,000-5,000 inhabitants.\""

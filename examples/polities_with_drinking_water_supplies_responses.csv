Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Soviet Union during its time between 1918 CE and 1991 CE. Let's break this down step by step.

First, what exactly is a Drinking Water Supply System? From the question, it's defined as polity-owned buildings that supply drinking water, either owned by the state or the community. So I need to determine if such a system existed in the Soviet Union during its history.

The Soviet Union was a socialist state from 1922 until its dissolution in 1991. It included both the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (RSFSR) and the independent Ukrainian SSR, among others. The period before 1924 was under the Bolsheviks led by Lenin, who implemented some watering systems but not as extensive.

Starting from 1918, the Bolsheviks took over power after Lenin's assassination in November 1917, so that year is when the Russian Revolution began. However, the actual establishment of the Soviet government happened a bit later, around March 1922 with the formation of the RSFSR.

In the early years of the Soviet Union, there were attempts to implement centralized systems for various services, including water supply. Lenin's administration in 1920s tried to centralize power and establish a collectivized economy, which included infrastructure projects. However, these were often short-lived because of political changes and internal dissent.

The 1930s saw the Great Purge under Stalin, which led to mass repression and disruption of many systems, including any tentative water supply initiatives. After Stalin's death in 1953, there was a brief period where some reforms were attempted, but the system was unstable due to periodic changes in leadership.

The post-Stalin era saw a mix of construction projects under Khrushchev, such as large dams and hydroelectric plants, which would provide water. However, these were often state-owned enterprises with limited local supply, so while there might have been infrastructure, it wasn't necessarily a community-owned system.

In the later part of the 20th century, from the late 1970s onwards, the Soviet Union was decaying due to economic problems, political instability, and declining living standards. This period would likely have seen less investment in public services like drinking water supply systems because of resource shifts towards other priorities.

I should also consider the urban planning aspect. The Soviet Union had a planned economy where cities were designed with central control over resources. While they built many public buildings for housing and utilities, these often included water supply as part of the infrastructure but not necessarily as community-owned systems. They were state-owned or at least controlled by the government.

Additionally, during times of crisis, such as the 1980s economic slowdown, there might have been temporary measures to improve water supply, but nothing on the scale of a comprehensive system would be expected.

So putting this all together: The Soviet Union did have some infrastructure projects aimed at providing drinking water under various leaders and policies, but these were often not consistent or were replaced by newer projects. By the mid-20th century, it's unlikely that a stable Drinking Water Supply System in the way defined would have been present because of the political changes, instability, and resource allocation issues.

Therefore, I think the system was absent during most of the Soviet era except for brief periods when there were infrastructure projects, which didn't last.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether a specialized drinking water supply system existed in La Tene C2-D between 175 BCE and 27 BCE. First, I should probably recall what La Tene is—wait, no, that's actually a real historical site located near Pavingstones, England, known for its Neolithic stone circles like Stonehenge. Wait, but the user might be referring to ""La Tene C2-D"" as a fictional or perhaps less commonly known polity in their question? Hmm, maybe I should consider both possibilities.

Wait, no, looking back at the history of this response system, it seems that ""La Tene"" is often associated with Neolithic England. So perhaps the user is referring to La Tene C2-D as a specific region or group within that context. But given that, the time frame is 175 BCE to 27 BCE, which would place them in the early Roman times, specifically during the First and Second Punic Wars period.

In ancient times, especially around this era, most polities had their own systems of providing water for drinking. Many city-states or kingdoms built infrastructure including water supply systems. For example, Rome built aqueducts, but smaller towns or regions might have simpler systems, like wells or cisterns that the community used.

Given that La Tene C2-D is a Neolithic site, perhaps they were part of a larger polity where water was managed by the state or local authority. Considering the time period, the Roman Empire was expanding and contracting, but regions under Roman control would likely have some form of centralized water management to ensure access for all citizens.

However, without more specific information about La Tene C2-D's governance structure during that time, it's a bit tricky. But leaning on historical trends, most polities around that period did have some form of drinking water supply system, whether it was from the state or local authorities. So I would expect that such a system existed.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System in the Kannauj - Varman Dynasty between 650 CE and 780 CE. Hmm, first off, I'm not super familiar with this specific dynasty, but I know that the Varman Dynasties were in present-day India, part of the NorthWest Indian subcontinent. They were known for their extensive administrative systems, trade networks, and maybe infrastructure.

I remember that many ancient empires focused on managing water resources effectively because water was crucial for agriculture, drinking, and transportation. So, it's plausible they might have had some system in place to supply drinking water. But I'm not sure if it was a specialized building or owned by the state or community as per the definition.

Thinking about other empires, like the Indus Valley Civilization around 2500-1750 BCE, they did have sophisticated water management systems with reservoirs and canals. The Mesoamerican cities had elaborate systems too, so maybe it's common across various ancient polities to invest in such infrastructure.

But wait, the Varman Dynasties were more modern than that; they existed from around 650 CE to 780 CE. I'm trying to recall if there are any specific examples of water supply systems during this period. I don't remember any major droughts or aridity issues in the region at that time, which would have pushed for better water management. Also, trade routes and cities growing in that area might have required good water supplies.

I should consider the administrative structure as well. If the polity was centralized, they might have had a system where the state owned it, perhaps through palaces or official buildings equipped with such systems. Alternatively, if it's community-based, maybe there were infrastructure projects initiated by local populations.

Another angle is looking at the social class and governance—Varman Dynasties were known for their efficient governance and perhaps their ability to invest in public infrastructure. So, having a Drinking Water Supply System might have been part of that investment to support the growing population and economy.

But I'm not entirely sure about specific examples or data from this exact period. It's possible that while such systems existed in other parts of India around the same time, there might not be specific records linking them directly to the Varman Dynasty. Maybe they were more common in other regions during this era rather than the Kannauj area specifically.

Also, considering the political stability and resources allocated: from 650 to 780 CE is a relatively short period compared to earlier dynasties, so perhaps there was less emphasis on such systems if the region wasn't facing water-related challenges. Alternatively, if the Varman people were known for their agricultural advancements, they might have needed better irrigation and water supply.

In summary, without specific evidence pointing to the absence of a Drinking Water Supply System in the Kannauj - Varman Dynasty during that period, it's reasonable to expect that such a system would be present. It aligns with general trends of resource management in ancient polities, especially in regions where agriculture and urbanization were significant.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Southern Mesopotamia during its Neolithic period, which was between 9000 BCE and 5501 BCE. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that Southern Mesopotamia refers to what is now southern Iraq, and the Neolithic period is when people started farming. Mesopotamia is famous for being one of the earliest cradles of civilization, with cities like Uruk, which are associated with the development of writing (cuneiform) and law.

Water was crucial for agriculture because farming requires irrigation. In the early stages of agriculture, water might have been obtained through various means—perhaps wells, rivers, or even rainfall. However, as settled agriculture became more widespread, especially in urban areas, having a reliable water supply system would become essential to support the growing population and increased agricultural output.

I recall that ancient Mesopotamia had sophisticated irrigation systems by the time of Sumerian civilization (around 4000 BCE). They used canals and ziggurats for watering crops. But was this considered a ""drinking water supply system"" as defined here? The question defines it as polity-owned buildings or community sources, so if the water supply was maintained by the state or a governing body, that would count.

Also, around 3500 BCE, Sumerians built cities like Uruk with extensive infrastructure. These cities likely had systems to manage water for both drinking and farming. Even in more primitive stages, some communities might have had rudimentary water storage solutions, such as elevated jars or containers to hold rainwater for domestic use.

Moreover, the Shurupak period (around 4000-3500 BCE) saw the development of cuneiform writing, which would have required a stable administrative system. An effective water supply system would have been part of this infrastructure to support administration and record-keeping.

However, considering that Southern Mesopotamia might not have been as urbanized or settled at certain times during its Neolithic period compared to the central region (modern-day Iraq), maybe the complexity of a full-fledged drinking water supply system was less developed. But by 3500 BCE, which is within the given time frame, evidence suggests that such systems were present.

So putting it all together, even in Southern Mesopotamia during its Neolithic period, especially as cities started to develop around 3500 BCE, a Drinking Water Supply System would likely have been present. Therefore, I'd expect the answer to be 'present'.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Western Roman Empire between 395 CE and 476 CE. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

First, the time frame: from 395 to 476 CE. That's when the Western Roman Empire lost much of its territorial integrity, especially after the fall of the Eastern Empire in 395 due to the Visigoths. So the empire's borders were definitely shrinking.

The definition given is that a Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS) exists if it's ""polity owned,"" which includes being owned by the community or the state. I need to determine whether, during this period, such systems existed in the Western Roman Empire as a whole or not.

I recall that in the later periods of the Roman Empire, especially after the fall of the Western part around 476 CE (when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus), many cities probably lost their independent governance. However, some smaller settlements might have continued under local leadership for a time before integration into a centralized system became impossible.

But wait, were there any DWSS in the Roman Empire at all? I think that even in the early Roman times, cities had water supply systems, often involving aqueducts. But as empires declined, these systems would have become less common because of lack of maintenance and political instability.

Looking between 395 and 476 CE, the empire was fragmented into small kingdoms and duchies. For example, the Goths and other Germanic tribes occupied parts of the empire after the fall. They might have set up their own systems or perhaps used existing ones from the previous Roman governance.

However, considering that much of the West was depopulated and isolated, it's possible that many communities didn't have reliable water sources. But even if some had, maintaining a DWSS would require significant investment in infrastructure, which wasn't feasible for small states or nomadic groups who were moving around.

Moreover, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, the area became part of the Visigoths' empire under the Suebi, but that's outside the current scope. So between 395 and 476, it was more about local kingdoms rather than a centralized system.

Putting this together, I don't expect that most communities in the Western Roman Empire had a DWSS during this period. They might have used whatever water sources they could find, but these systems were likely absent or non-existent on a widespread scale.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Rouran Khaganate between 300 CE and 555 CE. Hmm, I don't know much about this polity, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I should understand what a Drinking Water Supply System entails. It's basically having specialized buildings where water is supplied, either owned by the polity or the community. So, if there are places like water towers, treatment plants, maybe even infrastructure that ensures clean drinking water, then it would be present. If not, then absent.

I don't know much about Rouran Khaganate specifically, but I can think of similar historical contexts. For instance, many ancient civilizations had systems to manage water. The Indus Valley civilization, for example, was known for its efficient drainage system and perhaps some centralised water management. Also, empires often invested in infrastructure that supported their growing populations.

Considering the time frame from 300 CE to 555 CE, this period includes several historical events. I'm thinking of the Roman Empire's expansion and decline, but Rouran Khaganate is likely a distinct polity rather than part of Rome. Maybe it's an ethnic group with their own governance.

If Rouran Khaganate was a well-established polity, they might have had systems to manage resources like water. Water is crucial for agriculture, drinking, and urban development. Without proper infrastructure, managing water could be challenging, especially as the population grew.

I also recall that in many medieval societies, there were aqueducts and reservoirs built for practical reasons. If Rouran Khaganate was a center of trade or culture, they might have needed reliable water sources.

But wait, I'm not sure if Rouran Khaganate is as large or complex as some other ancient empires. If it's a smaller polity, maybe resources weren't as prioritized. Or perhaps the focus was more on military infrastructure rather than domestic water supply.

Another angle: maybe there were rivers that provided water, so they didn't need elaborate systems. Or perhaps rainwater harvesting was common in their environment. That would make having a specialized drinking water supply system unnecessary or absent.

I'm also considering if there's any historical evidence about water management practices during this period for Rouran Khaganate. Without specific records, it's hard to say definitively. But given the general trend of empires investing in infrastructure for growth and administration, I might lean towards present.

Wait, but I'm not certain about their exact governance structure or resources allocated. It's possible that while they had some infrastructure, a dedicated Drinking Water Supply System wasn't present. Maybe water was sourced from whichever was available without centralised management.

I think the answer is probably 'present,' assuming they had the capability and resources to manage it, but I'm not entirely sure.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Second Turk Khaganate between 682 CE and 744 CE. First, I should understand what exactly this polity was. From what I remember, the Second Turk Khaganate was part of the Golden Horde, which was an empire established after the Mongol conquests. It collapsed around the 15th century, so it's definitely a pre-empted state.

Now, about the Drinking Water Supply System (DWS). I know that such systems usually involve specialized buildings like water towers or reservoirs, and they're often managed by the state or local polity to ensure access to clean water. In many ancient and medieval societies, especially those in the Mongol Empire's sphere of influence, access to water was crucial for daily life, agriculture, and trade.

The Second Turk Khaganate was a relatively small empire compared to the Golden Horde as a whole, so maybe resources were limited. However, considering its location near Central Asia and the Silk Road, it might have had some control over local water sources. The Mongols themselves had an extensive irrigation system in their occupied areas, but since this polity collapsed, I'm not sure if they maintained it.

I should also think about the historical context of the time period (682-744 CE). That's during the reign of Khemanei Khan and his successors. The Turk Khaganate was known for its administrative efficiency under certain leaders, but by 700s, there were internal issues like the fight between Agha Khan and Baybars. These conflicts might have disrupted the polity, making it harder to implement a DWS.

Moreover, if the polity collapsed around 744 CE after Baybars' defeat, that likely means they didn't maintain any infrastructure beyond what was necessary for survival in the short term. If there were no resources or motivation to build and manage a water supply system, it's possible it was absent.

On the other hand, maybe parts of the empire still had access to rivers or existing Mongol constructions like water towers. But without centralized management, it would be hard to classify this as a present DWS within the polity itself.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Ashikaga Shogunate, which was in existence from 1336 CE to 1467 CE. Let's start by breaking down what a Drinking Water Supply System entails. It refers to specialized buildings where drinking water is supplied—this could include places like government buildings, temples, or even private residences with such facilities.

The Ashikaga Shogunate was a significant period in Japanese history, known for its centralization of power under the shoguns. During this time, Japan was under the control of the daimyo and later the samurai warrior class, but after 1350 CE, the shoguns took over as the ruling class. The shogunate implemented various reforms to consolidate their power, which included infrastructure developments.

I remember that in many civilizations and cultures, having a reliable water supply system was crucial for daily life, especially in urban areas. For example, the ancient Egyptians had sophisticated irrigation systems, and other civilizations also developed complex drainage and供水 systems. Japan is no exception; they would have needed such systems to ensure access to clean drinking water, which is vital for health and hygiene.

The Ashikaga period saw the decline of the daimyo class but was still a time when Japan was developing its infrastructure. The samurai warrior class had some control over land, governance, and military, but the shoguns took charge after 1350. I think that during this transition, there would have been efforts to standardize administrative structures, which likely included improving public services like water supply.

Additionally, Japan's history shows a trend towards centralizing resources as power becomes centralized. The shogunate would have needed reliable sources of fresh water for their capital city and other important locations. Without such systems, maintaining the health of the samurai class or the administration could have been a problem.

Moreover, in many historical contexts, especially under centralized rule, the government often invests in infrastructure to support governance. This includes public buildings with potable water supplies—like town halls, temples, and administrative offices. So it's plausible that during the Ashikaga period, these specialized buildings were present as part of the state's infrastructure.

However, I should consider if there are any historical records or sources indicating whether such systems existed. From what I recall, Japan had well-developed drainage systems by the Edo period (1603-1867), which was after the Ashikaga period. But during the Ashikaga Shogunate, while they might not have had modern piped water supply systems, they likely had some form of centralized water management, such as reservoirs or filtration methods.

In conclusion, it seems reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System would be present during the Ashikaga Shogunate based on the need for efficient governance and the centralized nature of the polity. The absence of modern infrastructure doesn't necessarily mean there was no system; they might have used simpler but effective methods.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Heian, which was between 794 CE and 1185 CE. The question defines the system as special buildings owned by the polity, either through the state or community. If it was present, I answer 'present', else 'absent'.

First, I remember that Heian is often called the Golden Age of Japan, a period of prosperity and cultural development. During this time, there were significant urban developments, including the construction of temples and shrines. Temples in many places would have needed access to clean water for their sacred purposes.

I recall that in Japan, especially in cities like Kyoto, which was a major center during Heian, water supply systems were crucial. The Edo period (which comes after Heian) saw the development of municipal water supplies with the help of samurai and Lord governors creating waterworks to bring clean water from distant sources.

But wait, Heian is before Edo. So maybe it's a bit earlier than that. I think that during Heian, there were already some systems in place because they were pre-Edo. For example, temples had their own water systems, bringing water from onsen or using filtered river water. Maybe the samurai class would have had their own water sources for drinking.

Also, Heian was a time of centralization and administration under the Emperor. It's plausible that the government took steps to improve infrastructure, including water supply. Towns might have built reservoirs or used river water with filtration.

I should consider if there were any major events or issues during Heian that would affect water supply systems. Natural disasters like flooding could disrupt water sources, but I don't know specific examples from Heian's time affecting water systems directly.

Another thought: trade and commerce might have influenced water needs, so as cities grew, they likely needed better water systems to support the population and economy.

Putting it all together, while Edo period had more advanced systems, Heian itself was a time when Japan started developing these systems. So maybe by 1000 CE or later, such systems were already present.
</think>

The polity 'Heian' existed from 794 to 1185 CE, during a period of significant urban development and cultural prosperity. Given this context, it is reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Nara Kingdom had a drinking water supply system. The question defines it as specialized buildings that are owned by the polity, either individually or collectively, including the state.

First, I'll recall what I know about the Nara Period. It's between 710 CE and 794 CE, after Japan was unified under a central government for the first time with Emperor-sama. This period is famous for several innovations and changes in social structure.

I remember that during this time, infrastructure started to improve. Town planning became more standardized, which might have included better public buildings like granaries or temples. Since the polity owned these structures, it's possible they would also own water supply systems if necessary.

Water was probably a basic necessity, so having a reliable source made sense. Maybe they had reservoirs or dikes built to manage water resources. Also, with urbanization increasing, proper drainage and filtration systems might have been developed for better hygiene.

However, I'm not sure about the specifics of water supply systems in Nara. It's possible that while they didn't have modern sewage systems, they did have rudimentary water management. Given that towns were organized more centrally, it would make sense that the state or polity provided such services as part of governance and maintaining order.

So considering all this, I think the drinking water supply system was present in Nara.
</think>

The Nara Period, marked by significant political unification and societal change, saw infrastructure improvements. Recognizing the necessity for reliable water supplies, it's reasonable to infer that the polity owned such systems through specialized buildings, reflecting their role in governance and urban management.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Later Wagadu Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on my knowledge of world history. First, I should recall what I know about the Later汪州帝国, also known as the Wangadu Empire. It existed from 1078 CE to 1203 CE, which was a time when various empires were rising and falling across East Asia.

I remember that during this period, there were several prominent empires like the Song, Tang, Han, and Five Dynasties periods. The Later汪州帝国 was part of the broader political landscape in China around 1100 CE. I think it's important to consider the socio-economic conditions of the time because having a Drinking Water Supply System (DWS) would depend on factors like infrastructure development, resource availability, and governance.

I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of their infrastructure, but I do recall that some empires in China during this period had advanced city planning and drainage systems. For example, the Song Dynasty is often mentioned for its urbanization and engineering projects. If the Later汪州 Empire was similar, they might have had specialized buildings or systems to manage water supplies.

However, there's also a possibility that their resources were limited compared to later periods. The time frame of 1078-1203 CE includes the fall of the Tang Dynasty and the rise of other empowers like the Song, which was quite prosperous. But the Later汪州 Empire might have faced challenges such as droughts or conflicts with neighboring states that could have affected their water resources.

Additionally, I should consider if there were any inscriptions or historical records mentioning a DWS in the Later汪州 Empire. If no such references exist, it might suggest that they didn't have one. On the other hand, if inscriptions mention infrastructure projects related to water management, that would indicate a DWS was present.

I also wonder about their access to rivers and lakes. Water supply systems often rely on natural water sources like rivers or wells. If the Later汪州 Empire had extensive river systems under their control, they might have had the resources to build infrastructure for water distribution.

Furthermore, technological advancements during this period could play a role. If they used similar techniques as later empires, such as reservoirs or canals, it would support the presence of a DWS. However, without concrete evidence, speculation is necessary.

In summary, while there's no direct information confirming the existence of a Drinking Water Supply System in the Later汪州 Empire, considering their historical context and potential infrastructure needs, it's plausible that such a system might have been present. On the other hand, limited resources or lack of records could mean it was absent.
</think>

The Later汪州帝国 (1078–1203 CE) existed within a broader period of Chinese history marked by various empires and socio-economic developments. While there is no explicit evidence confirming the presence of a Drinking Water Supply System, factors such as potential infrastructure projects akin to later Song Dynasty engineering and access to natural water sources could suggest its existence. However, without concrete records, it remains speculative.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Middle Wagadu Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on what I know about their history. Let me start by recalling what I know about this polity.

The Middle Wagadu Empire existed between 700 CE and 1077 CE. It was part of the Deccan Sultanate in South India, known for its rich culture and administrative systems. The empire was renowned for its agricultural advancements, including crop rotation, which would have required good water management to sustain their fertile land.

I remember that during the Sangam literature period (from 10th to 12th centuries CE), which overlaps with parts of the Middle Wagadu Empire's existence, there were records of irrigation systems. These systems often included canals and reservoirs built by rulers to manage water supply efficiently for agriculture. The Sangam songs sometimes mentioned agricultural practices and the importance of water.

Moreover, the Middle Wagadu Empire had a centralized administration, which would have necessitated an organized water supply system to ensure that all regions received adequate water. Without such a system, managing water distribution could have been chaotic, leading to droughts or shortages, which would have affected crop yields and thus the empire's economy.

Also, considering their administrative structure, they likely had systems in place for infrastructure development. The presence of rivers and surrounding areas made it possible to build reservoirs or canals that supplied the entire empire with water during dry seasons. This kind of engineering capability suggests that a Drinking Water Supply System would have been present.

Additionally, historical sources from the Sangam period often highlight the engineering marvels of their time. They built cities like Solappur and Parvad, which were known for their advanced urban planning and infrastructure, including water systems. The emperor Ashokan had a great reservoir built in his capital city, indicating that effective water management was considered important.

So putting this all together: the Middle Wagadu Empire's emphasis on agriculture, their centralized administration, and historical records suggesting engineering marvels all point towards having a Drinking Water Supply System present during their time.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Late Formative Basin of Mexico had a Drinking Water Supply System during the period between 400 BCE and 101 BCE. Let me start by breaking down what that means.

First, the Late Formative Basin refers to a region in Mexico that was part of the early Aztec empire or its predecessors. It's located in modern-day states like Oaxaca and Chiapas. The time frame given is from around 400 BCE to 101 BCE, which includes the formation of the AztecEmpire but also some earlier periods.

The question mentions a Drinking Water Supply System (DWS) as something that includes specialized buildings owned by the polity or its community. So I'm looking for evidence of any infrastructure related to water supply—like reservoirs, pipes, tanks, maybe even entire buildings dedicated to providing clean water.

I remember that in Mesoamerica during this period, there were still traditional water systems using natural sources like wells and rivers. The Aztecs had a decentralized system with local Gallupi (water suppliers) who used wells. However, these were not standardized across the empire; each region might have its own system based on local geography.

By 400 BCE, the region was part of the Zapotec culture, which already had some water supply systems relying on natural springs and rivers. The later periods under the Aztecs saw the decline of such traditional systems as the empire expanded and faced more challenges like droughts and increased urbanization.

I also recall that while there were efforts to improve water management during the Aztec period, they often relied on terraced agriculture (kukallopas) for water conservation. But even then, this was a subsistence strategy rather than a comprehensive supply system.

So considering all this, it's possible that before the Aztecs fully took over in the 10th century BCE, there were still local water systems using natural sources. The DWS as defined by specialized buildings might not have been present if they were relying on traditional methods without centralized infrastructure.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards absent because during this period, it was more about decentralized, natural-based water supply rather than a structured system with specialized buildings.
</think>

The Late Formative Basin of Mexico, around the 400 BCE to 101 BCE period, primarily used decentralized, traditional water systems relying on natural sources like wells and rivers. While there were efforts during Aztec times to improve water management through terraced agriculture, these remained subsistence strategies without centralized infrastructure. Therefore, a Drinking Water Supply System as defined by specialized buildings was likely absent.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Terminal Formative Basin of Mexico between 100 BCE and 99 CE. First, let me understand what this polity was. The Terminal Formative Basin refers to a region that was part of the Aztec Empire during its last stages. The Aztecs were known for their advanced city-states like Tenochtitlan, which became Mexico City today.

I know that the Aztecs had a complex political and social structure with cities divided into populations centered around important buildings such as palaces, temples, and markets. These centers often had water supply systems because they were large urban areas. They likely used canals to bring water from distant sources like the Rio Grande or Guadalete river.

But wait, after the Aztec Empire fell in 1521, the region was conquered by Montezuma II of the Aztec league and then became part of the New World empire centered at Tenochtitlan. The Tlatelap and Totonac civilizations were important before the Spanish conquest. They might have had their own water systems, but I'm not sure if a polity-level Drinking Water Supply System would have been present.

The time frame given is 100 BCE to 99 CE, which is during the Aztec empire's decline and the formation of the Tlatelap culture. The Tlatelap were known for their efficient irrigation systems, but I'm not certain if they had a centralized water supply system like the one that existed in the Aztec capital.

Also, the definition says it's polity owned, which includes community or state ownership. If the polity was decentralized, maybe each city-state handled its water supply separately without a unified system. But historical sources suggest that large cities did have elaborate systems to manage water distribution across their extensive areas.

However, since the polity in question is the Terminal Formative Basin, which might be more of an early Aztec city before it fell, I'm leaning towards thinking they had some form of drinking water supply. Maybe not as complex as later ones, but still present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether an Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS) was present in the Indo-Greek Kingdom between 180 BCE and 10 BCE. The polity is considered a small, centralized state with significant administrative control over its domain.

First, I should recall what an DWSS entails. It's a system where the state or community owns specialized buildings for providing drinking water, which could include infrastructure like wells, pipes, filtration systems, and possibly communal buildings where people can access this water.

The Indo-Greek Kingdom, also known as the Mauryan Empire in ancient times but later replaced by the Mauryas. It was a vast empire that stretched from present-day Pakistan to the Black Sea region. The period given is 180 BCE to 10 BCE, so we're looking at its鼎盛 period.

During this time, the polity would have had a centralized government structure with administrative control. Centralized systems often require standardized infrastructure for efficient governance and administration. Access to clean water would be essential for maintaining public health, regulating agriculture, and ensuring the well-being of the population, which was crucial given the size and complexity of the empire.

In ancient empires, especially those with extensive territories, it's common for rulers to invest in infrastructure to manage resources effectively. Clean water would help prevent diseases, support crops, and maintain morale. The Mauryan Empire is known for its efficient administration and record-keeping, which might have included maintaining records of water usage or distribution.

Also, the polity would have had control over various localities under their governance, so having a system to manage water supplies across multiple regions makes sense. Specialized buildings like reservoirs, treatment plants, and distribution networks could be part of this infrastructure.

Moreover, in many ancient civilizations, especially those with large populations or territories, access to clean water was often a point of contention or investment. The Mauryan Empire might have had systems in place to ensure that every city, town, and village within their borders had access to clean drinking water.

However, I should consider if there were any historical records or sources that mention the presence of such systems during this period. Since the Indo-Greek Kingdom is a reconstruction from later sources like Herodotus and Strabo, which date back to much later periods (5th-1st centuries BCE), it's possible that these sources might not reflect the actual state of the polity at 180 BCE.

Additionally, during the Mauryan period, there were significant changes in governance and infrastructure. The transition from the Samudryas (warlords) to Ashoka's Maurya dynasty involved a shift towards centralized control and administration. This likely included investments in infrastructure like roads, granaries, and water systems to support state activities.

In conclusion, considering the centralized nature of the polity, the need for public health and efficient governance, and historical context about resource management in ancient empires, it's reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System would have been present.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Egypt had a Drinking Water Supply System during their Kushite Period, which was between 747 BCE and 656 BCE. First off, I remember that the Kushite Period refers to the reigns of Pharaohhotep II (690-671 BCE) and his son Seqenenrepsot Tutankhamun's father or an ancestor, but I might be mixing up some details here.

I know that Egypt had a long history with their pharaonic periods, each known for specific architectural styles. For example, the Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BCE) was more about pyramids and_step pyramids, while the Intermediate Period (2035-1761 BCE) saw things like the狮柱 (qubataiyun), which are significant in their architecture.

I also recall that during the Kushite Period, Egypt went through some changes. There were periods of foreign rule, like being part of the First and Second Intermediate Kingdoms under Pharaohhotep II's brother, who was an Egyptian general. But after his death, Egypt became a vassal state to the Assyrians until Tutankhamun's reign in the New Kingdom (1369-1334 BCE), where there were significant architectural innovations.

Now, thinking about the Kushite Period itself, which is between 747 and 656 BCE. During this time, Egypt was still under Pharaohhotep II and his son Tutankhamun. Wait, no—Pharaohhotep II died in 671 BCE, so he ruled from around 690 to 671 BCE. Then his son Tutankhamun took over after him or perhaps after his brother. I think the Kushite Period ended when Tutankhamun was a pharaoh. So maybe the Kushite Period includes Tutankhamun's reign.

If Tutankhamun was a pharaoh, then his period would be part of the Kushite Period. Now, thinking about water supply systems during that time: in New Kingdom Egypt (after Tutankhamun), there were significant advancements in city planning and infrastructure. They built canals for irrigation, which suggests they had sophisticated water management systems.

But was this system in place before Tutankhamun's reign? I'm not sure. If the Kushite Period included his rule, then perhaps it would have such a system. However, if the Kushite Period was earlier than his reign, maybe around 747-656 BCE, that could be part of an earlier period where water supply systems weren't as developed.

Wait, but Tutankhamun's reign is considered one of the peak periods of the New Kingdom (13th to 12th centuries BCE), which had significant engineering feats. The Valley of the Sun and the White Stair are examples, indicating advanced architecture and possibly engineering skills that might include water systems.

But I'm not certain if these innovations happened after Tutankhamun became pharaoh or before. If it's during his reign, then maybe the Kushite Period would have had such a system. However, if it was earlier, perhaps in an Intermediate Period, maybe the system wasn't present yet.

I think that by the Kushite Period, Egypt had already started developing these systems because they were building structures like the狮柱 and other monumental architecture. So even if Tutankhamun's reign is part of the Kushite Period, it might have been before his time when the water supply system was in place.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the Kushite Period included Tutankhamun or not. If Tutankhamun was the last ruler of the Kushite Period, then perhaps he would be the one to bring such systems into use. So if the period is up until his reign, maybe it's absent before that and present during.

Alternatively, if the Kushite Period predated Tutankhamun's rule, then perhaps the system wasn't as developed yet. I'm not entirely sure about the exact timeline here.

Another angle: looking at other Kushite rulers, like those who preceded Tutankhamun. They might have had varying levels of infrastructure investment. If their water systems were absent but improved around Tutankhamun's reign, then perhaps during his time it was present.

I'm leaning towards the idea that by the Kushite Period, especially during Tutankhamun's rule, a Drinking Water Supply System would have been present due to the architectural and engineering advancements of the New Kingdom. So I think it should be marked as present.
</think>

The Kushite Period in Egypt, spanning from 747 BCE to 656 BCE, likely included the reigns of Pharaohhotep II and his son Tutankhamun. During Tutankhamun's rule, which is considered part of the Kushite Period, significant architectural advancements occurred, including the construction of structures like the狮柱 (qubataiyun). These developments suggest that advanced engineering and water management systems were in place during this period. Therefore, it can be expected that a Drinking Water Supply System was present during the Kushite Period, particularly during Tutankhamun's reign.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the polity Himyar II between 378 CE and 525 CE. First, I should understand what the Himyar II polity was. From what I remember, Himyar II was an Amorite dynasty that ruled over parts of the Arabian Peninsula during the early Islamic period.

I know that during this time, many regions were under the control of the Umayyads or the Abbasids, but the Himyars had their own governance. The polity was relatively small and existed in the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. I'm not sure if they had access to fresh water sources like rivers or if they relied on salted water from wells.

Hydration is crucial for any polity, especially in arid regions. Fresh water would help support agriculture, trade, and daily life. In some cases, empires built reservoirs or used natural springs as reliable sources of water. However, given the size of the Himyar II polity, it might have been challenging to maintain a dedicated water supply system.

I also remember that in Islamic expansion, especially during the early centuries, there was emphasis on organizing and managing resources efficiently. The Umayyads, for instance, built infrastructure like roads and canals, but I'm not sure about their water systems. If the Himyar II polity was independent, they might have developed their own solutions.

It's possible that during this period, without access to major rivers or a centralized water management system, the Himyar II might have struggled with providing reliable drinking water. They might have relied on wells and imported water from nearby regions controlled by other empires. If there were no dedicated systems, they would have faced issues like water scarcity as seasons changed.

Moreover, considering their location in the desert, it's plausible that water sources were limited. Access to salted water was common, but fresh water might not have been as available. So maybe they didn't have a Drinking Water Supply System as defined by the presence of specialized buildings or organized systems owned by the polity.

I also need to think about any historical records or sources from this period that mention the existence of such systems in Himyar II. If there are none, it might lean towards absent. Additionally, if neighboring regions didn't have such systems either, it could suggest that the Himyar II didn't prioritize water infrastructure.

In summary, given their geographical location and the time period, I would expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was probably absent in the polity of Himyar II.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Konya Plain during the Early Bronze Age, which was between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE. Hmm, let's start by breaking down what I know about this period and region.

First, the Konya Plain is an area in Anatolia, near modern-day Turkey. The Early Bronze Age (EBA) lasted from around 3500 BCE to 1600 BCE, so it's part of that broader historical context. During this time, many early civilizations began to emerge, such as the Hittites, Phrygians, and various Neolithic cultures.

Now, the question is about a Drinking Water Supply System (DWS). From what I understand, DWS refers to specialized structures or systems where drinking water was sourced, stored, distributed, treated, and regulated. This could include things like wells with stone foundations, cisterns, pipes, or even more complex systems involving reservoirs and distribution networks.

I recall that many early urban centers during the EBA period had some form of infrastructure to manage water resources. For example, the Hittites are known for their city-states, which were well-planned and included water management features like wells. The Hittites, who lived in the region around Konya, might have had systems in place to provide water for their settlements.

However, I should also consider that the EBA was a period of both development and environmental stress. The plain might have been subject to seasonal changes or droughts, which would make having an effective water supply system even more critical. Early civilizations often developed sophisticated irrigation systems to manage water during such challenges.

Additionally, there's the aspect of trade and commerce. Many early polities were interconnected through trade routes that included water sources. If a polity had access to a reliable water source, it could facilitate trade, which in turn supported the growth of cities and states.

But wait, I should also think about the size and complexity of the polity. The Konya Plain might have been part of a larger network or perhaps several independent city-states. If the area was more fragmented, each city-state might have developed its own water management systems independently rather than relying on a centralized supply system.

Also, considering the materials used for constructing such systems is important. Early EBA cultures likely had basic construction techniques using local materials, which could limit the complexity and scale of their water supply infrastructure compared to later periods.

Moreover, I remember that some sources suggest that the Hittites built a well in Konya as part of their city's infrastructure. This would imply that they did have a Drinking Water Supply System. On the other hand, if there were isolated communities without such systems, perhaps due to environmental factors or lack of resources, those areas might not have had DWS.

I should also think about any archaeological evidence from this period in Konya related to water infrastructure. If there are records or artifacts indicating the presence of wells, cisterns, or pipes, that would support the presence of a DWS. However, since I don't have specific information on this, I'll need to rely more on historical accounts and trade networks.

Another angle is the role of agriculture. The Konya Plain was known for fertile land, which might necessitate efficient irrigation systems rather than centralized water supply. Early cities there could have used local rivers or wells to support their agricultural needs, but perhaps without a centralised system unless it was integrated into their urban planning.

In summary, considering the Hittite example and the importance of water during the EBA for subsistence and trade, it's plausible that many polities in the Konya Plain did have Drinking Water Supply Systems. However, the overall presence would depend on whether these systems were widespread or if they varied between city-states or independent communities.

Given all this, I think it's reasonable to expect that such a system was present in some areas but perhaps absent in others due to varying social structures, environmental conditions, and political organization.
</think>

The Konya Plain during the Early Bronze Age (EBA) period likely experienced a mix of polities with and without Drinking Water Supply Systems (DWS). While evidence suggests that city-states like the Hittites may have incorporated DWS such as wells in their urban centers, the overall presence varied. Some areas might have had centralized systems due to strategic trade routes or agricultural needs, while others could have relied on local water sources without a formalized supply system. Thus, the expectation is that certain polities within the Konya Plain had DWS, but it was not uniformly present across all regions.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Eastern Roman Empire between 395 CE and 631 CE. Hmm, let me start by breaking this down.

First, I know that the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantium, was around for about 1,000 years until its fall to the Ottomans. The period from 395 CE is when Justinian I started his reign, right? So the empire's political structure and infrastructure would have been pretty stable during this time.

I remember that in many city-states or urban centers, especially under emperors like Justinian who were known for their building projects, there was probably a need for proper water supply. Cities often had to deal with water shortages, so having systems to manage it would be essential for daily life and public works.

Justinian's time is famous for things like the Aqueduct of Thessalonica and other infrastructure projects. That suggests that they were investing in their cities' utilities, including water supplies. So maybe by 395 CE, a system was already in place or at least on its way to being established.

But then I think about later periods. The Byzantine Empire fell around 1453 to the Ottomans, and many of the city-states were taken over by the Ottomans. If the Ottomans took over, they might have changed infrastructure practices, but the question is specifically about whether it was present during the Eastern Roman period.

Also, I recall that Justinian's time had a focus on centralized governance, which would imply a well-organized system for resources like water. The presence of special buildings or institutions dedicated to water supply supports this idea.

So putting it all together, I think the Drinking Water Supply System was present in the Eastern Roman Empire during its existence.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity like Cahokia - Lohman-Stirling had a drinking water supply system. First, I should probably recall what Cahokia was. From what I remember, Cahokia is an ancient city in present-day Illinois, part of the Mississippian culture. It was known for being one of their largest cities around 1050 CE. 

The time frame given here is from 1050 CE to 1199 CE, which aligns with when Cahokia existed and then declined after that. Now, I'm trying to remember if Mississippian cultures typically had systems for getting water, like wells or pipes. I think a lot of their cities were built around natural resources available at the time. 

I recall that many ancient cities needed water because it's essential for drinking, agriculture, and daily life. But without written records from Cahokia specifically, I have to go off other Mississippian sites. From what I've read before, a lot of these cultures had access to local water sources, maybe wells or rivers. 

Also, since they were around for nearly 500 years, it's likely that they developed some way to supply water reliably. Maybe they built reservoirs or used natural channels. Plus, the Mississippian people were known for their engineering skills, so they probably had systems in place to manage water effectively.

So putting it all together, even if we don't know specifically about Cahokia, given that other Mississippian cities did have ways to supply water and considering the time period when Cahokia existed, I would expect a drinking water supply system to be present.
</think>

The presence of a drinking water supply system in the polity of Cahokia - Lohman-Stirling can be expected. Given its location and historical context as part of the Mississippian culture, which typically had access to natural water sources and engineering skills to manage water systems, it is reasonable to conclude that such a system was present during its time period (1050 CE to 1199 CE).

Okay, so I need to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System in Cahokia-Moorehead between 1200 CE and 1275 CE. I'm not super familiar with the history of this polity, but I know it's an Ancestral Puebloan settlement located in what is now Arizona.

First, I'll recall that Cahokia was known for its monumental architecture, like the Great House complex. These structures were probably used as residences or centers of government. Water supply systems often go hand in hand with infrastructure and administrative centers because they need a reliable source of water for drinking, irrigation, and possibly for cooking and卫生 purposes.

I think about when Cahokia declined. It was around 1200 CE according to some sources I remember reading. But wait, the time frame here is up until 1275 CE, which is after its decline. So maybe by then it had already lost its main water supply or perhaps incorporated a system.

I also remember that Puebloan cultures typically relied on natural water sources like rivers for drinking and irrigation. If Cahokia-Moorehead was in an area with seasonal or permanent water supplies, they might not have needed as elaborate systems. But if the river dried up or wasn't accessible anymore, they might have had to develop alternative methods.

Another point is that the collapse of the Ancestral Puebloan cultures (like Chaco Culture) was partly due to environmental factors and over-reliance on certain resources. If Cahokia-Moorehead faced similar issues, maybe their water supply system declined as well.

I'm also considering if there were any later revivals or rebuilding efforts after 1200 CE that might have revived their water systems. However, I don't recall specific information about that period for Cahokia-Moorehead.

Given all this, it's possible that by 1275 CE, the polity had already transitioned and perhaps incorporated a drinking water supply system, maybe even integrating better infrastructure as part of their recovery or restructuring after decline. Alternatively, if they lost access to a reliable water source before then, they might have gone without.

I'm leaning towards 'present' because many polities in that period did develop such systems during their peak times, but considering the time frame up until 1275 CE and knowing that Cahokia declined around that time, I think it's more likely that the system was absent after its decline.
</think>

The drinking water supply system for Cahokia-Moorehead between 1200 CE and 1275 CE is expected to be absent. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. **Historical Context**: Cahokia-Moorehead declined around 1200 CE, indicating a possible decline in infrastructure.
2. **Water Reliance**: Puebloan cultures often relied on natural water sources, which might have become less accessible or reliable after the decline.
3. **Post-Delay Factors**: Environmental factors and resource management could have contributed to the decline, potentially leading to the absence of an elaborate water system by 1275 CE.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity like Cahokia had a drinking water supply system. I know that Cahokia was an early woodenland society in the Mississippian culture, existing from around 600 BCE to 150 BCE. 

First, I should recall what a drinking water supply system entails. It's about whether the polity had buildings or infrastructure for providing water—either by community ownership, like houses with wells, or through some centralized system.

Cahokia was known for its large city-states. They built earthen mounds called Cahokia Mound, which were massive structures. These mounds were likely used as reservoirs because they can hold a lot of water and are impermeable once dry. So, if they had these mounds, that would serve as a water supply system.

Also, many Mississippian cultures built earthen channels and basins to collect water from natural sources like rivers or wetlands. These channels would distribute water to homes and public buildings, providing a reliable water supply without needing complex infrastructure like pipes.

Given that Cahokia was one of the largest centers in their culture, it's likely they had such systems in place. They probably used local geography and materials to create sustainable water sources. Plus, being a polity, they would have needed reliable water for both residential and ceremonial purposes.

I don't recall any information indicating that Cahokia didn't have access to water or didn't build these kinds of structures. So putting this together, it's reasonable to expect the presence of a drinking water supply system in Cahokia.
</think>

The early Mississippian polity of Cahokia, known for its large city-states from 600 BCE to 150 BCE, utilized earthen mounds and channels to manage water supplies. These structures were essential for providing reliable water sources, both for residential and ceremonial needs. Therefore, a Drinking Water Supply System was expected to be present.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System was present in Cahokia during the Mississippian II period (900 CE to 1049 CE). I'm not super familiar with all the details about this polity, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that Cahokia is an Ancestral Puebloan village located in modern-day Arizona. It was part of the Mississippian culture, which thrived from around 800 CE to about 1200 CE. The Mississippian II period specifically started around 900 CE, so I should focus on that timeframe.

I remember hearing that Cahokia declined after a peak around 1050 CE and died out later. But what about its infrastructure? Water supply systems are crucial for sustaining large polities because without reliable water sources, communities can't function effectively.

Looking at similar civilizations, the Mississippian culture was known for their complex society structures with cities that had distinct zones: domestic life in the inner city (tepee zone), trade and crafts in the middle zone, and religious and political activities in the outer zone. This suggests a well-organized system that might have included infrastructure to manage resources like water.

I also recall that Cahokia was built on an alluvial deposit of river silt, which could support aquatic life but not permanent fresh water supplies. The Mississippian people were skilled engineers and likely developed systems to address their water needs. They might have used wells or reservoirs, though I'm not entirely sure how widespread this was.

I should consider the time frame. If they built Cahokia around 900 CE, it's possible that by then they had some infrastructure in place. However, if their capital declined after 1050 CE, maybe their water systems weren't maintained beyond that point. But absence doesn't mean they didn't have any system; perhaps they just changed or adapted.

I'm also thinking about the decline of Cahokia. After its peak at around 1048 CE, it died out later, but I don't know exactly when. If the polity declined before water supply systems became irrelevant, maybe those systems weren't necessary anymore, leading to their absence from records after the collapse.

Another angle is that if the Mississippian culture generally had advanced engineering skills, they might have had a centralized system for water distribution within their cities. But without specific evidence from Cahokia specifically during the Mississippian II period, it's hard to say definitively.

I think I should look up some historical sources or scholarly articles that discuss Cahokia's history and infrastructure during this period. They might mention whether there were any systems in place for water supply at that time. Unfortunately, without access to specific sources right now, I have to rely on general knowledge about Mississippian cultures.

In summary, while it's possible they had a Drinking Water Supply System around the time of Cahokia's construction (900 CE), the decline after 1050 CE might mean that such systems became obsolete or were not maintained. Alternatively, perhaps their system was so well-integrated into daily life that it's difficult to distinguish from other aspects of their society.

I'm leaning towards 'absent' because even if they had a system, its decline and the polity's collapse likely made it irrelevant as a distinct feature after the period in question. However, I'm not entirely certain without more specific information about Cahokia's infrastructure during that time.
</think>

The consideration of whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Cahokia during Mississippian II (900 CE–1049 CE) involves examining the polity's historical context and infrastructure. While there is no definitive evidence of such a system at its peak around 900 CE, the decline by approximately 1050 CE likely made any pre-decline systems obsolete or irrelevant due to the polity's collapse. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Drinking Water Supply System would be absent after this period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System in Cahokia during the Late Woodland III period, which was from 600 CE to 750 CE. Let me start by recalling what I know about Cahokia.

Cahokia is an ancient city located along the Mississippi River in what's now Illinois, USA. It's part of the Mississippian culture, which flourished during the early to mid-Common Era—specifically from around 350 CE to 900 CE. The Late Woodland III period starts at 600 CE and ends at 750 CE. So this is within the broader Mississippian context but a bit later, towards the end of their decline.

I remember that Cahokia was a major center during its peak, known for its monumental architecture like mounds and petroglyphs. But after its fall, there's not much historical evidence left about what happened to its infrastructure. The city declined significantly by 700 CE, which is near the end of the Late Woodland III period.

Thinking about water systems in ancient cities, many had sophisticated drainage systems or aqueducts, especially those that were part of larger polities. However, Cahokia's decline suggests that it might have lost its infrastructure. The Mississippian culture faced various challenges like drought, invasions, and competition with other cultures such as the Aztecs to the north.

If there was a Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS), it would likely be part of the city's administrative or ceremonial functions. However, given that Cahokia declined by 700 CE, it's possible that its water system wasn't maintained beyond that point. But wait, did it decline before 600 CE? I think the decline started around 500-600 CE, so maybe the DWSS was present up until then and absent after.

I should also consider if there are any remnants or artifacts from Cahokia's later period indicating a water system. Unfortunately, most of that evidence is scarce because the city was abandoned quickly after its fall. So, it's plausible that by 600 CE, the city had lost its DWSS as part of its decline.

Alternatively, maybe during peak times around 500-600 CE, the city still functioned with some water supply, but beyond that, it was absent. Therefore, I would expect the DWSS to be present up until about 600 CE and then absent after.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Cahokia between 1275 CE and 1400 CE based on what I know about the polity. First, I should recall what Cahokia was like during that time.

Cahokia is known as the Great Sioux City, right? It was a major pre-Columbian city-state in the Midwest. From what I remember, it was built around 1200 CE and flourished for several centuries. During its peak, it was one of the largest cities in North America, maybe even bigger than modern cities like Chicago or Minneapolis.

Now, considering the time frame given is from 1275 to 1400 CE, which is after its prime but still during a period when trade and cultural decline might have started. I know that Cahokia declined around the 13th century, so by 1400 it was probably in a declining phase.

Water supply systems were crucial for urban centers because without reliable water, cities couldn't sustain themselves. Places like Mesopotamia had sophisticated irrigation systems, and many ancient city-states built elaborate reservoirs or relied on trade for water supplies. But for a polity of Cahokia's size, especially when it was in decline, the need might have diminished.

I also remember that Cahokia declined due to various factors: environmental issues like drought, maybe overpopulation, conflict with rival city-states (like the Mississippis) who were expanding their influence, and perhaps internal governance problems. If the primary reasons for decline are outside water supply, then it's possible that a dedicated water system wasn't as important anymore.

Moreover, during times of decline, people might have relied more on what was available rather than having elaborate systems. Also, if Cahokia was losing its power and influence, perhaps they didn't prioritize maintaining such infrastructure.

So putting this all together, I think it's possible that by 1275 CE when the polity existed, a Drinking Water Supply System wasn't present anymore because their main reasons for decline didn't hinge on water. Therefore, expecting it to be absent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Cahokia during its Mississippian I period, which was from 750 CE to 900 CE. First, I should probably understand what exactly a Drinking Water Supply System entails. From the question, it's defined as specialized buildings owned by the polity or community that provide drinking water. So, this could include structures like wells, reservoirs, filtration systems, etc.

Cahokia is known as one of the largest prehistoric mounds built in the region, and it was a significant site for the Mississippian culture. The Mississippian period is known for their urbanization and complex society, so having a system to supply water would make sense for their growing populations. They likely needed reliable water sources for drinking, irrigation, and possibly for other community needs.

I should consider the time frame: 750-900 CE is when Cahokia was at its peak. The Mississippian people were renowned for their ability to manage resources sustainably, including water. I recall that large cities often had systems in place to ensure a steady water supply, especially if they relied on seasonal rains or river sources.

I don't remember hearing about any specific absence of such systems during this period, but maybe it wasn't as advanced as later periods. However, given the social complexity and infrastructure they built, it's reasonable to expect that they had some form of water management structures. Perhaps not as elaborate as in later civilizations, but definitely present.

Also, considering that Cahokia was a hub for trade and migration, ensuring a reliable water supply would have been crucial for their sustenance and interactions with neighboring communities.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Durrani Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on its history between 1747 CE and 1826 CE. First, I should recall what I know about the Durrani Empire. It was an Islamic principality in Central Asia, right? They were known for their administrative efficiency and their use of a system called qanat, which is like an underground network used for irrigation.

Wait, qanats are for water supply, but they're specifically used for agricultural purposes. The Durrani Empire probably needed reliable water sources for their agriculture, which was crucial because they relied heavily on pastoral herds in the deserts of Central Asia. So if qanats were their main water system, that would mean they had a specialized infrastructure for water supply.

But the question is about a Drinking Water Supply System. I'm not entirely sure if this refers to just irrigation or any kind of drinking water system. If it's specifically for drinking purposes beyond agriculture, maybe they didn't need as much because their population might have been more nomadic and less dependent on permanent drinking water sources.

However, in the historical context, even if they were primarily using qanats for irrigation, which also provided drinking water for domestic use, especially during dry seasons, it's possible that they had some system. Plus, with their vast territory and diverse regions, maybe there was a central supply system in place to ensure all parts of the empire had access to water.

I should also consider if there were any empires or dynasties before or after the Durrani Empire that had similar systems and see how they were structured. For example, earlier Islamic states might have had simpler water systems, but as empires grew, they often developed more complex infrastructure, including centralized supply systems.

But wait, the Durrani Empire was known for its efficient administration, so it's plausible they integrated a drinking water system into their governance to manage resources effectively across their large empire. Therefore, my initial thought is that they likely had such a system in place.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom between 256 BCE and 125 BCE. Hmm, let's start by understanding what exactly this system entails. It seems like it refers to specialized buildings where water is supplied—either owned by the polity or the community itself.

First, I should probably break down who the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was. From what I remember, it was a Greco-Persian Empire that existed during the 3rd century BCE and continued until 125 BCE when Alexander the Great defeated the last Persian king, Darius III. It's known for its vast empire stretching from Greece to modern-day Afghanistan.

Now, considering the time frame—256 BCE to 125 BCE—I need to think about the political structure of that period. The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was likely a centralized empire under Parthian rule before Alexander took over in 330 BCE. Under Parthians, there might have been a system where different regions had varying degrees of autonomy, but there was still some level of central control.

Water supply systems would have been crucial for agriculture, urban development, and maintaining the health of their people. In ancient empires, especially large ones like the GRECO-BACTRIAN KINGDOM, having an organized water supply system could be a sign of organizational complexity and possibly centralized administration.

But wait, I'm not sure about the specifics. The GRECO-BACTRIAN KINGDOM was known for its extensive network of roads, cities, and agriculture. They were known to manage resources efficiently, so maybe they had some form of water management. However, their political structure might have been more complex than a simple state with a clear hierarchy.

I'm trying to remember if there are any historical sources or inscriptions from this period that mention anything about water supply systems in the GRECO-BACTRIAN KINGDOM. I don't recall specific references, but given their emphasis on infrastructure and governance, it's possible they did have such systems. Alternatively, maybe the level of detail was limited because the administration wasn't as well-documented as other empires.

Also, considering the time period ends in 125 BCE, that's when Alexander took over. Under his rule, he might have introduced more centralized governance which could have included better infrastructure like water systems to support the military campaigns and administration.

But wait, Alexander was a Hellenistic ruler, so perhaps after his conquests, there was some adaptation of the existing systems into what became the Roman Empire. However, the GRECO-BACTRIAN KINGDOM existed before Alexander's rule, so during the period in question, it might have evolved independently or under their own administration.

I'm also thinking about the definition: the system is ""polity owned,"" which could mean either the state or community owned. The GRECO-BACTRIAN KINGDOM was a polity, so they would likely have owned such systems. But were these systems present during that time?

Maybe looking at similar empires can help. For example, the Mauryan Empire in India had a well-developed irrigation system and water supply. The Indus Valley Civilization also had advanced water management. But the GRECO-BACTRIAN KINGDOM might not have had such systems because they were smaller or perhaps their focus was more on military rather than extensive agriculture.

Alternatively, if they were part of a larger Persian empire that did have water systems under Parthian rule, maybe parts of their domain did as well. But the GRECO-BACTRIAN Kingdom itself might not have had them.

I'm also considering the resources available at the time. Water was essential for farming in many parts of the empire, so having a supply system would help sustain large populations and agricultural activities. If they were an agrarian society, it's plausible they had such systems. However, if their economy was more focused on trade or warfare, maybe not.

But given that they were a GRECO-BACTRIAN polity and I don't have specific information indicating the absence of water supply systems during this period, perhaps expecting them to be present is safer based on general trends in ancient empires. However, without concrete evidence, it's hard to say for sure.

Wait, maybe looking at their administrative structure can give a clue. If they had cities and infrastructure, they likely needed a way to manage water resources efficiently within the city-states or provinces. Centralized administration would require some form of organized system.

So, putting this all together: considering the period, the polity's nature, and the necessity for water supply systems in an agrarian society, I'm leaning towards expecting that such a system was present.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the Kushan Empire had a drinking water supply system in place between 35 CE and 319 CE. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Kushans.

First off, the Kushan Empire was one of the most powerful empires in ancient history, covering regions from modern-day India to North Africa and parts of the Middle East. It was known for its vast administration and infrastructure. The empire was founded by Emperor Ashoka in 263 BCE but, unfortunately, he died young, so the empire was ruled by his son. However, our period of interest is much later, starting from 35 CE when Vasi crabtree became emperor until 319 CE.

Now, considering the time frame we're looking at—around 35 CE to 319 CE—I should think about what kinds of infrastructure were present during this period. The Kushans were known for their cities like Mithila, which is famous as one of the largest urban centers in Roman times. Cities being a key part of an empire's administration would likely have had access to resources and services.

Drinking water supply systems could involve various components: wells, pipes, reservoirs, filtration systems, etc. The Kushans were known for their engineering skills. They built roads, bridges, and canals, so it's plausible they would also have a system for providing potable water.

Additionally, during the Roman period that followed the Kushan Empire (they were actually part of the Roman administration), cities like Dindies, Patna, and Taxila were under Roman control. These cities did have systems for water supply, often supplied from local wells or aqueducts. The Kushans would likely have inherited or adapted these systems.

Also, considering the social structure and population size—such a large empire with many cities and settlements—it's unlikely that every individual had access to personal drinking water without a centralized system. Instead, a polity (the Kushan Empire) would reasonably own such infrastructure to manage resources efficiently for all its citizens.

Moreover, empires often have a bureaucracy responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure necessary for their operations. So, it's reasonable to expect that they would have systems in place for water supply as part of their administrative structure.

I should also think about any known archaeological evidence from Kushan cities like Mithila or Akalpika (also known as Lepakisa). These cities were well-developed with extensive networks of roads and drainage systems. It's plausible that they had subterranean water sources, which would be part of their drinking supply system.

In conclusion, considering the size and administrative complexity of the Kushan Empire during this period, along with their engineering capabilities inherited from Ashoka's empire and later Roman parallels, it's highly likely that a Drinking Water Supply System was present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Eastern Han Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on their buildings. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Eastern Han Empire. It was a Chinese dynasty that existed from 25 CE to 220 CE. They were known for being one of China's most unified and prosperous periods.

I remember that during this time, the Chinese made significant advancements in various fields, including infrastructure and public services. The Han Dynasty built an extensive road network connecting different regions, which suggests they had a well-organized system to move people and goods around. This kind of centralized infrastructure often includes some form of water supply because roads are part of the transportation networks needed for trade and governance.

Also, in ancient times, especially during efficient empires like the Han, there was probably an emphasis on improving living conditions through better infrastructure. Drinking water is essential for daily life, so having a system would make sense to provide clean and sufficient water to people across the empire. The emperor might have had specific buildings or facilities dedicated to this purpose.

I should consider if there are any historical records or sources that mention the presence of such systems during the Han Dynasty. I know that in other empires, like the Qin or the Tang, they did have advanced engineering for water supply, so it's plausible that the Han also had similar systems.

Moreover, thinking about urbanization and the need for resources, a polity as large as the Eastern Han would require an efficient way to distribute water. This could include specialized buildings where water was stored, treated, or distributed, such as reservoirs with filtration systems or maybe even more advanced centralized facilities like a capital city with extensive infrastructure.

I also recall that during the Han Dynasty, there were advancements in engineering and public works, which would support the development of infrastructure like drinking water systems. The Emperor's Decree on Granaries is an example of how resources were managed efficiently, so having similar measures for water distribution makes sense.

However, I should be careful not to assume too much without concrete evidence. While there are no direct mentions in some sources, considering their engineering capabilities and the need for such a system, it's reasonable to expect that they would have had one.

So, putting this all together, I think the Eastern Han Empire likely did have a Drinking Water Supply System because of their centralized governance, efficient infrastructure needs, and capacity for advanced resource management.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a drinking water supply system was present in the Umayyad Caliphate between 661 CE and 750 CE. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Umayyads were an Islamic dynasty that ruled over parts of the Middle East and North Africa from 661 to 750 CE. They were a relatively short-lived empire compared to some others like the Ottomans or the Safavids, but they did cover a lot of territory.

I know that during the medieval period, many empires focused on developing infrastructure for their cities because urbanization was increasing. Cities often needed proper water supplies, especially in areas with hot climates where water was essential for drinking and hygiene. So maybe they had some sort of system?

But wait, the Umayyads were a bit different from other Islamic empires. They were known for their religious tolerance and their expansion through conquest rather than internal improvement. I think that sometimes when empires conquer new territories, they don't always adapt their infrastructure to suit the local conditions, which can lead to issues like inadequate water supplies.

Also, around 700 CE, Muslim rulers began to consolidate control in Spain under Al-Andalus, and later in North Africa with the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids might have been more focused on establishing administrative systems and infrastructure tailored to their expanding empire, which could mean a shift away from the Umayyads' water supply system.

Furthermore, during the 7th century, there was a period of relative stagnation in many Islamic cities because of lack of investment in public works. The Umayyads might have been hit by this too. Plus, as empires decline, their ability to maintain efficient systems diminishes.

I'm also thinking about other factors like the availability of natural resources. If the areas they controlled had adequate water sources already, maybe there wasn't a need for elaborate supply systems. But if the water was scarce or unreliable, they would probably invest in better infrastructure.

Wait, I recall that the Umayyads did face issues with their water supply because their empire extended into regions where water was not easily accessible. They might have had to rely on imports or less efficient methods, which could make a specialized system absent for much of their time.

So putting it all together: the Umayyad Caliphate existed during a period when empires were consolidating and sometimes underfinanced. Their focus was more on military conquest rather than urban infrastructure, leading to possible inefficiencies in water supply systems. Plus, as they expanded into areas with challenging hydrology, maintaining or developing such a system might have been absent.

I'm leaning towards the conclusion that the Drinking Water Supply System was absent during their rule.
</think>

The Umayyad Caliphate's drinking water supply system was likely absent during their rule from 661 CE to 750 CE. This conclusion is based on factors such as their focus on military conquest over infrastructure development, potential challenges in water availability across their vast empire, and the broader decline of infrastructure investment during the 7th century. These elements suggest that a specialized drinking water supply system was absent during this period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Konya Plain during the Late Bronze Age II period, which was between 1500 BCE and 1400 BCE. 

First, I should recall what the Konya Plain area is known for historically. From what I remember, the Konya region, now part of modern-day Turkey, was a significant center during the Hittite Empire. The Hittites were prominent around that time period and had a substantial influence in the region.

Now, thinking about water supply systems, ancient civilizations often needed reliable sources of water for drinking, irrigation, and other essential needs. The presence of such systems would likely depend on factors like geography, access to natural resources, and social organization.

The Konya Plain was probably situated near significant water sources. Since it's a plain area, which usually means fertile and possibly with seasonal or permanent water supplies, the Hittites might have had an advantage in securing water. Additionally, the Hittite Empire was known for its efficient administration and infrastructure, including cities that served as focal points for resources.

However, I also need to consider the broader context of the Late Bronze Age II period. This era saw several empires rise and fall, including the Hittites. The presence of a Drinking Water Supply System would have been crucial not just for the immediate polity but also for sustaining their settlements and populations. If the Konya Plain was under Hittite control during this time, they might have had access to local water sources like rivers or reservoirs.

I'm trying to remember if there are any specific examples of water management systems from that period in the region. From what I vaguely recall, some ancient cities did have such systems, often integrated into their city-planning and infrastructure. The Hittites were known for their monumental architecture and efficient use of resources, so it's plausible they had a system for managing water.

Another point is whether the Konya Plain was part of a larger trade network that relied on water transport. If trade was integral to their economy, having reliable water supply would have been essential for both domestic use and commerce.

But wait, I also need to think about possible limitations. Were there any challenges in maintaining such a system during the Late Bronze Age? Water scarcity could be a problem, especially if the area didn't have enough natural resources or if neighboring regions were less cooperative. Also, environmental changes like droughts would affect water availability.

Considering all this together, it seems likely that the Konya Plain, under Hittite rule, would have had access to an adequate water supply system. The strategic location and the nature of their society suggest that such a system was present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a drinking water supply system existed in the Hatti New Kingdom polity between 1400 BCE and 1180 BCE. First, I should recall what I know about the Hatti culture and their history.

Hatti is one of the oldest cultures in Sub-Saharan Africa, known for its advanced urban planning and early city-states like Edo. The New Kingdom period they're asking about is between around 1350-1204 BCE, which falls within the broader Hattian era, but I think it's specifically associated with their early cities such as Edo.

I remember that in many ancient civilizations, especially those with complex social structures, having a reliable water supply was crucial. It helps with daily life, agriculture, and maintaining public infrastructure like buildings and roads. The presence of specialized buildings for water management suggests a well-organized system, possibly including reservoirs, filtration systems, and distribution networks.

In some of the Hatti city-states, like Edo, there are remnants of their old fortifications that might include structures related to water management. For example, walls or dikes could have been built as part of the city's defense, which sometimes served dual purposes, including holding or regulating water flow. However, I'm not sure if these were specifically designated as drinking water supply systems.

I also think about the role of local leaders and administrators in managing resources. If a polity had a stable government, they might invest in infrastructure to ensure water availability. Considering that the Hatti New Kingdom was part of their broader city-based states, it's possible they had such systems. However, without specific evidence, I can't be certain.

Another point is the presence of trade and commerce. Many early civilizations set up water supply systems for irrigation or drinking purposes because they relied heavily on agriculture. If Hatti engaged in trade, having a reliable water source would have been essential, especially if importing goods was part of their economy.

I should also consider any historical sources or artifacts from that period. If there are inscriptions mentioning reservoirs or water management structures, that would support the presence. But without such evidence, it's speculative to say they had a present system.

In summary, while it's possible that Hatti in the New Kingdom era had a drinking water supply system, especially considering their urban planning and possibly investing in infrastructure for defense and agriculture, I can't confirm its absence either. However, without concrete proof from inscriptions or artifacts, I might lean towards expecting it to be absent unless there's specific indication otherwise.
</think>

The Hatti New Kingdom polity, existing between 1400 BCE and 1180 BCE, likely lacked a drinking water supply system based on the available evidence. While advanced urban planning suggests possible investments in infrastructure, historical records or artifacts from this period do not specifically indicate the presence of such systems. Therefore, it is expected that the Drinking Water Supply System was absent.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Neo-Hittite Kingdoms would have had a Drinking Water Supply System. First, I should understand what the Neo-Hittite Kingdoms were like. From what I remember, they existed between around 1180 BCE and 900 BCE, based in the ancient region of Hittite Cyprus. They were known for their city-states, each with its own ruler, and their political structure was quite advanced.

Now, thinking about water supply systems. Many civilizations had some form of water management because controlling water was crucial for agriculture, drinking, and daily life. For example, the Egyptians had the Nile, which was vital for them. The Spartans in ancient Greece had a water system too, but I don't think they used a specific term like ""drinking water supply system.""

The Neo-Hittites were known for their urban planning; cities like Ephesus and Troy are mentioned as examples of their architectural and engineering skills. They built elaborate infrastructure, including water systems. Hittite rulers often had control over various resources, so it's plausible they would manage water similarly.

I should also consider the time period. The Neo-Hittites were around during the Bronze Age, before the rise of the Phoenicians who became famous for their seafaring and trade. However, the Hittites themselves didn't develop their own alphabet or writing, but that doesn't necessarily mean they lacked infrastructure.

Water supply systems could have been in the form of reservoirs, canals, or filtration methods. For example, the ancient Greeks often had water towers, though not exactly like the modern version. The Hittites might have used similar principles, especially since their cities were well-planned and needed reliable water sources for agriculture.

Moreover, trade with neighboring regions would have required efficient water management to ensure a stable supply of goods and water. This could necessitate the establishment of systems by the Neo-Hittites as part of their administration.

So putting it all together, given their advanced city-states, engineering skills, and strategic importance in trade, I expect that the Neo-Hittite Kingdoms did have a Drinking Water Supply System.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Great Ming polity, which spanned from 1368 CE to 1644 CE. First, I'll break down what a Drinking Water Supply System entails according to the definition given. It's about specialized buildings owned by the polity or its communities that provide drinking water. So, if such structures existed under the Ming dynasty, either through imperial ownership or the local communities, then it would be present; otherwise, absent.

I know the Ming dynasty was a period in Chinese history under the Han and later Joseon dynasties. It's known for its development of urbanization and infrastructure because they were one of the earliest to adopt permanent cities instead of nomadic tribes. The Ming emphasis on trade routes, especially through the Silk Road, suggests a well-developed economy that would have needed reliable water sources.

Water supply systems in ancient times often involved channels, wells, aqueducts, and reservoirs. The Ming likely built infrastructure for both their capitals like Beijing and other cities to ensure a steady water supply for drinking and irrigation. They probably had specialized buildings such as water treatment facilities or towers where water was processed before distribution. These structures were necessary not just for the capital but also for growing crops in colder climates, which would require water from sources like rivers.

Considering that the Ming were a centralized polity, they might have had control over these infrastructure projects. However, I'm not sure if they specifically designated entire buildings as dedicated drinking water supply systems or if it was more about maintaining and upgrading existing infrastructure through regular maintenance rather than building new specialized structures each time. 

I also recall that during the Ming, there were advancements in technology, including better drainage systems to prevent flooding, which indirectly supports a reliable water supply. The presence of rivers like the Yangtze and Yellow River provided ample water sources, so they likely had systems to manage this effectively.

On the other hand, while it's possible that the term ""drinking water supply system"" might be more modern or specifically associated with certain engineering projects, historical records from the Ming don't explicitly mention such specialized buildings. However, given their infrastructure development and need for reliable water, it's reasonable to infer that they did have systems in place.

So, putting this all together, I think a Drinking Water Supply System would have been present during the Great Ming polity.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Tang Dynasty II, which was from 763 CE to 907 CE. First, I remember that the Tang Dynasty was one of China's most powerful and longest-ruling dynasties. They were known for their advancements in various fields, including infrastructure.

I know that during the Tang Dynasty, there were significant improvements in urban planning and public services. For example, they built cities like Xian (Xi'an) which are still bustling today. I recall something about them installing water supply systems as part of these developments. Maybe they had special buildings for managing water sources?

But wait, Tang Dynasty II specifically started in 763 CE after the death of Emperor Li Wangdi. That was a time when China was going through some major changes, especially with the collapse of the Five Dynasties period. So maybe this dynasty's drinking water system would have been similar to other empires' systems at that time.

I'm not sure about the specifics, but I think that in many ancient civilizations, including China, having a reliable water supply was crucial for daily life, agriculture, and trade. The Tang Dynasty probably invested in infrastructure to ensure access to clean water, especially as cities grew larger.

Also, the term ""Drinking Water Supply System"" suggests it's a polity-owned system, which includes both state and community ownership. Given that the Tang Dynasty was centralized, I think they would have owned such systems. So putting this all together, I expect that during Tang Dynasty II, there was a Drinking Water Supply System present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Tairona between 1050 CE and 1524 CE. First, I should recall what Tairona was. From history, Tairona is also known as Chavín de Huántar, an Andean city that was the administrative center of the Inca Empire. It's located near the Andes mountain range in modern-day Peru.

Now, thinking about the time period—1050 to 1524 CE. That's covering several empires and periods: the Incas from around 1300 until their downfall in the early 16th century, the Spanish Conquistadors arriving later, so maybe from 1524 onwards they were in control.

The Drinking Water Supply System refers to whether the polity had specialized buildings for drinking water, which could be owned by the state or the community. I know that many ancient and medieval cities had sophisticated systems for providing water. For example, the Incas are famous for their engineering feats like the Great engineers who built an impressive network of canals for irrigation.

Chavín de Huántar was a major Inca center, so it's plausible they had such a system. The Incas were known for their efficient administration and infrastructure, including roads, buildings, and water systems. They likely used wells or aqueducts to supply water to the city, especially since the surrounding terrain is hilly, which would necessitate a good drainage system.

Moreover, during the Inca period, there was a centralized government, so it's possible that they had state-owned infrastructure projects, including drinking water supplies. The Incas were also one of the first civilizations to use terraced agriculture (khipu valleys), which probably included the use of water systems for farming.

However, after the Inca Empire fell in 1533 CE, Tairona was conquered by the Spanish. Although the period we're considering ends at 1524 CE, just before Conquistadors arrived, it's possible that under Pachacuti's rule (the last Inca emperor), the city continued to operate with its existing systems.

So putting this together, I expect that Tairona had a Drinking Water Supply System during the Inca period. After their decline, whether it was absent or not depends on if the Spanish took over and if they continued using the same system. But since the question is about the existence in general for the polity, even if the system was disrupted later, I think the answer would be present.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Shuar - Colonial polity between 1534 CE and 1830 CE. I don't know much about this specific polity, but I can try to break down what I need to consider.

First, let's define what a Drinking Water Supply System entails. The question says it includes specialized buildings that are either owned by the polity or the state. So if the Shuar - Colonial had such buildings for providing water, it would be present; otherwise, absent.

I know that in many early colonial systems, especially those with indigenous populations, there were often challenges with access to clean drinking water. Without proper infrastructure, diseases like malaria and dysentery could spread easily. This might have been a key reason why having a reliable water supply was important.

Looking at the time frame from 1534 to 1830 CE, this period is during European colonization in the Americas, specifically where the indigenous populations were being exploited for labor. The Shuar group is likely one of these indigenous peoples who were brought as slaves and later freed but maintained their cultural practices.

I recall that many indigenous communities historically had well systems or at least water sources from natural springs. However, as they were subjected to colonial rule, these resources might have been disrupted. They might have relied on nearby European settlements for clean water initially, especially if those settlements provided淡水.

But over time, if the Shuar - Colonial managed to resist or adapt, maybe they built their own systems. On the other hand, if they remained dependent on European sources indefinitely, no system would exist.

Another factor is whether the polity had administrative structures that could support such a system. Specialized buildings for water supply might require expertise and management, which an independent indigenous polity might have had control over initially but possibly ceded to colonial authorities later.

I'm also thinking about examples from history. Many precolonial societies had elaborate irrigation systems or wells, but these often fell apart when colonizers took over. There are cases where indigenous populations adapted by building new sources or relying on more sustainable methods after losing old ones.

Considering the time frame ends in 1830, which is before the Compromise of 1805 and the end of slavery in the U.S., but varies by region. However, many indigenous communities in the Americas were already under colonial control by then. So if they had a system, it might have been disrupted or replaced.

I'm not sure about the exact situation with the Shuar - Colonial specifically, but given that they were part of a colonial system, it's possible their water supply was managed externally rather than having an indigenous system. Alternatively, maybe they built their own to maintain their culture and community needs despite colonial pressures.

So, weighing these factors, I'm leaning towards absent because being in a colonial context often meant relying on European sources for water unless they had the resources to build their own systems independently.
</think>

The Shuar - Colonial polity, existing between 1534 CE and 1830 CE, was part of a colonial system in the Americas. Given the historical context of colonial rule, which disrupted indigenous natural resources and shifted control over water sources, it is unlikely that they maintained an independent Drinking Water Supply System. Instead, their access to clean water may have depended on external European sources provided by settlements or colonial authorities. Therefore, absent.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Mamluk Sultanate III period in Egypt, which was from 1412 CE to 1517 CE. 

First, I should recall what the Mamluk Empire was like historically. The Mamlukes were a powerful rulership in Egypt and parts of the Arab world, established after the fall of the Umayyads. They were known for their administrative efficiency and infrastructure development.

I remember that during the height of the Mamluke rule, they built extensive systems of canals and dams to manage the Nile River effectively. The famous Suez Canal was constructed later on, but I think there were other major projects around water supply in their empire before that.

The Mamlukes were known for their well-organized administration, which would have included managing resources like drinking water efficiently across a large territory. They likely had systems in place to ensure that every city and village had access to clean water, especially since the Nile was a vital source of water.

Specialized buildings for water supply systems might include structures like reservoirs, treatment plants, and distribution networks. Given their organizational capabilities, it's plausible they had such infrastructure.

However, I should consider if there were any periods where these systems were absent or significantly altered during Mamluke rule. There might have been times of conflict or economic instability that affected water supply, but as a general expectation for the period, it seems reasonable to assume that such a system would be present.

So putting it all together, I think it's expected that a Drinking Water Supply System existed during Mamluk Sultanate III.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the Shuar polity in Ecuador had a Drinking Water Supply System between 1831 and 1931 CE. The system is defined as specialized buildings owned by the polity or its community, which includes the state if they're involved.

First, I should recall what the Shuar people were like. They are an indigenous group in Ecuador, living in the cusco region. From what I remember, their society was based on reciprocity and mutual aid rather than a centralized government. They had communities led by male leaders known as tupas, who were highly respected.

Since they didn't have a state-level government until recently (they gained autonomy in 2017), the polity they formed between 1831-1931 was likely decentralized and self-governed. Decentralized systems often rely on local traditions and mutual aid, which don't necessarily include formal water supply systems.

I also think about how water was used in their communities. Cusco has a history of droughts, so access to clean water might have been challenging. But without state infrastructure, they probably didn't invest in centralized systems like wells or pipes supplied by the government.

They might have had local solutions, such as relying on natural springs, rainwater collection, or seasonal water sources. These would fit within their decentralized system where community cooperation was key. There's no indication of a formal supply system because there wasn't much state intervention during that time either.

So putting it all together: the Shuar likely didn't have a Drinking Water Supply System based on how their polity functioned, their water sources, and the historical context without state involvement.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether an ancient Egyptian polity from around 3100 BCE to 2900 BCE would have had a Drinking Water Supply System. The system is defined as specialized buildings owned by the polity or their community. 

First, I should consider what kind of society existed during that time. Egypt was known for its monumental architecture and efficient administration under pharaohs. The early dynasties were likely centralized, with significant infrastructure projects.

Thinking about water supply, in ancient times, water was essential for agriculture, drinking, and urban life. Pharaohs would have needed reliable sources of water. They might have built reservoirs or used natural springs, especially if they were near the Nile River, which is a major water source in Egypt.

The user mentioned the Dynasty I period, which probably refers to an early Egyptian dynasty, maybe the 1st Dynasty. During this time, Egypt was part of the broader Egyptian Empire, but under later dynasties, there might have been more localized governance as pharaohs became more distant from their subjects.

Given that, I can imagine that even in the early periods, the pharaoh would need a reliable water system to sustain the population and support agriculture. They often built massive reservoirs like the ones at Aswan. These were not just for drinking but also for irrigation, which was crucial for farming along the Nile.

So, it's likely that such a system existed because the basic infrastructure needed for a settled society would include water supply, especially in an area as arid as Egypt.

The presence of a Drinking Water Supply System during Dynasty I (circa 3100–2900 BCE) is expected to be present. Ancient Egyptians, under their pharaohs, likely invested in infrastructure such as reservoirs to ensure reliable water supply for agriculture and urban use, essential for sustaining their population.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System in Egypt during Dynasty II, which existed from 2900 BCE to 2687 BCE. First, I should understand what the question is asking. The drinking water supply system refers to specialized buildings that provide access to safe or potable water, either owned by the polity (like the state) or the community. 

I remember that in ancient Egypt, they had a lot of monumental architecture, especially during the Pharaonic periods. Dynasty II would be part of the broader Egyptian history, which includes the Old Kingdom and later dynasties like III to VII. During these times, Egypt was under the control of the pharaohs, who were considered divine rulers.

Water supply in ancient Egypt was crucial because deserts and high altitudes could lead to water scarcity. The main sources were the Nubian River (Nile) and the White Nile. The construction of dams, like the Djoser Dam, started around 2650 BCE during the reign of Sesostris I, which is part of Dynasty II. Dams were essential for reservoirs that supplied the population with water.

So, if there were dams built in this period, that would mean a water supply system was present because it involved specialized buildings (like the dams themselves) owned by the state or the pharaohs. The construction and maintenance of these infrastructure projects indicate that the polity had systems to manage water resources. 

I also recall that during the reigns of pharaohs like Sesostris I, IV, V, VI, and VII, there were significant engineering projects aimed at improving agriculture and water management. The supply system would have been necessary for irrigation, which in turn supported agriculture vital to their economy.

Therefore, considering the engineering feats of the time and the need for reliable water sources, it's reasonable to conclude that a Drinking Water Supply System was present during Dynasty II.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt had a Drinking Water Supply System. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Mamluk dynasty. It was established after Saladin's death in 1187 and ruled from around 1260 CE until the Ottoman Turks conquered them in 1348.

I remember that the Mamluks were known for their efficient administration, especially in military terms. But did they also invest in infrastructure like water supply systems? I'm not entirely sure, but I think that during the peak of their rule, cities like Cairo were probably well-developed. They might have had access to natural resources such as the Nile River, which is a major source of water for many Middle Eastern cities.

I should consider whether they built infrastructure for drinking water or relied on natural sources. The Mamluks, being efficient rulers, likely focused on military and administrative reforms but maybe didn't prioritize public infrastructure like water supply systems to the same extent as later periods. However, having access to the Nile would mean that their people had a ready supply of water without needing specialized systems.

Also, in many ancient and medieval cities, especially along major rivers, drinking water wasn't always guaranteed because of varying river flows or management issues. So perhaps they didn't have a centralized system but relied on the river. But if that's the case, would that mean no Drinking Water Supply System at all?

Alternatively, maybe the Mamluks did start developing some infrastructure during their rule. I'm not sure about specific projects, though. They were more focused on defense and governance than on building up urban systems like water supply.

I should also think about neighboring empires or later periods. For example, after the Mamluks fell to the Ottomans, the Ottomans built extensive cities with better infrastructure, including water supply systems. But that doesn't necessarily tell me about the Mamlukes themselves.

In summary, I'm leaning towards thinking that the Mamluk Sultanate probably had access to natural water sources like the Nile, which would mean their drinking water wasn't absent. However, whether they had a formal Drinking Water Supply System as per the definition might be debatable because it's unclear if they had specialized buildings or systems in place.

Wait, but since the question defines the presence of the system based on ownership by the polity (including community or state), and considering that the Mamluks were a polity, perhaps they owned or controlled water supply through their administrative systems. But I'm not certain if they had anything like pipes or centralized systems for drinking water.

Given all this uncertainty, maybe it's safer to say that while they might have access to natural resources, there was no formal Drinking Water Supply System in place during their rule.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether an Egypt Mamluk Sultanate would have a Drinking Water Supply System based on my knowledge up until 2023. Let me break this down.

First off, the Mamluk Sultanate existed between 1260 CE and 1348 CE. They were an important part of Egyptian history, known for their administrative efficiency and infrastructure development. I remember that during their rule, Egypt was under Oghuz Turks but later became a caliphate before the Mamluks took over.

Now, considering the time period, around the late 13th to early 14th century CE. During this time, many empires were focusing on expanding their territories and improving their infrastructure for governance. The Mamluks are known for their efficient administration, so it's plausible they would have had systems in place that facilitated resource management.

Water supply systems are essential for sustaining large polities. I recall that during the reign of Suleiman I (1328–1347), Egypt was an integral part of the Mamluk Empire, and they likely inherited some infrastructure from their predecessors. The Oghuz Turks had a system with granaries and water systems, but when they were replaced by the Mamluks, there might have been adaptations.

Moreover, the Mamluks were known for managing resources efficiently. They probably implemented similar or improved systems to ensure a stable water supply, especially important for agriculture, which is crucial in Egypt. Without reliable water, maintaining productivity and governance would be challenging, so they'd likely invest in such infrastructure.

Also, considering their administrative capabilities, they could have centralized water management, ensuring that resources were distributed effectively across the vast territories they controlled. Centralized systems are often indicative of strong governance structures.

So putting it all together, given their focus on infrastructure and efficient administration, it's reasonable to expect that an Egypt Mamluk Sultanate would have a Drinking Water Supply System present.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System in Egypt during the Mamluk Sultanate III period, which was from 1412 to 1517 CE. 

First, I remember that the Mamluk dynasty was a significant power in Egypt, especially under their sultans like Saladin and his successors. They were known for expanding their empire extensively. Now, considering their size and resources, it's logical to think they might have had infrastructure that supported both daily life and military operations.

I also recall that during the medieval period, many empires went through various stages of development in terms of infrastructure. I'm not sure about specific examples from Egypt, but maybe places like Mesopotamia or Persia had well-developed water systems for their large populations. 

Thinking about the role of sultans and their administration, it's probable that they would have needed reliable sources of water to maintain their capital cities, which were probably massive centers with extensive populations. Without a proper supply system, diseases could spread quickly, affecting both the population and military effectiveness.

Additionally, considering their control over vast territories, ensuring access to water in all regions might have been crucial for trade, agriculture, and maintaining an efficient administration. Maybe they built infrastructure like canals or reservoirs, but I'm not entirely sure if a dedicated Drinking Water Supply System as we understand it today existed back then.

I should also think about the time period—14th to 16th century CE. That's when Mamluk became prominent and expanded their empire further into what is now southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It would make sense that they had systems in place for managing resources, including water, to sustain such an extensive territory.

Moreover, during this period, there were also challenges like conflicts or environmental changes which might have affected water availability. But the presence of a system suggests it was necessary for their operations, so even if there were issues, having some form of management would help mitigate those problems.

In summary, while I'm not certain about specific details, the Mamluk Sultanate's size and administrative needs likely required a robust Drinking Water Supply System to support their vast empire.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the drinking water supply system existed in Egypt during Dynasty 0, which was active between 3300 BCE and 3100 BCE. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details of Egyptian history, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I know that Dynasty 0 is considered an archaic period in Egyptian history, before the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Pharaohs like Menhotep III. This period was relatively short, only about 200 years, so maybe resources for a developed infrastructure weren't available yet.

Drinking water supply systems usually involve specialized buildings, like reservoirs, treatment plants, or distribution systems. I remember that in later periods of Egyptian history, such as the Old Kingdom (around 2686-2134 BCE) and the First Intermediate Period (after unification), they did have some水利 infrastructure. For example, there were granaries and possibly reservoirs used for irrigation.

But wait, Dynasty 0 is much earlier than that. So during this time, would they even need a drinking water supply system? Well, in the early periods of civilization, people might rely more on natural sources like rivers or wells without complex systems. They might have dug wells or relied on river flows, which are less permanent compared to reservoirs.

Also, construction for such systems is probably expensive and labor-intensive. If the polity was small or not very centralized, maybe they didn't invest in infrastructure that wasn't essential yet. Plus, considering the time frame of Dynasty 0 being around 3300-3100 BCE, this period coincides with the decline after the unification of Egypt and before the rise of new kingdoms.

I should also consider the economic factors. If water was abundant from natural sources without the need for storage or distribution, there might not have been a necessity for a specialized building system to manage it. So, perhaps during Dynasty 0, such systems were absent because they didn't exist yet in that context.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the polity called Yehuda between 141 BCE and 63 BCE. First, I should recall what Yehuda was. From my history classes, I remember that Yehuda refers to several Jewish communities, including the ones in Caesarea, Capernaum, and Nablus. These were important centers for Jewish activities during the Roman period.

Now, considering the time frame of 141 BCE to 63 BCE, this was a period when the Roman Empire was quite powerful but also facing internal conflicts and changes. The construction of cities like Caesarea under Augustus in 144 CE shows that they were being fortified around the time Yehuda's existence ends. However, the focus here is on the earlier part of the century.

During this time, there were Roman legions stationed in places like Capernaum and Nablus, which suggests a presence of Roman control. Roman law was implemented, so it's likely that public infrastructure would have been built to support their administration. Drinking water systems as we understand them today might have been part of this infrastructure.

I also recall that in ancient times, especially under Roman rule, there were standardized buildings and systems for housing and utilities. For example, the supply of water was often managed through specific facilities designed by the authorities. So it's plausible that such a system would exist to provide clean drinking water, which was essential for both daily life and religious rituals.

Additionally, considering the social structure of Jewish communities in this period, they likely needed access to reliable water sources, especially since much of their diet included fresh produce and beverages like wine. Without proper sanitation or clean drinking water, public health could have been an issue, which might be why the Roman authorities invested in such systems.

However, I should also consider if there were alternative methods of obtaining water during this time. Perhaps relying on local sources or natural springs? But given the broader trend towards centralized governance and infrastructure investment by Rome, it's more likely that they would have implemented a system even if alternative sources existed.

In conclusion, based on the presence of Roman control, Roman law requiring infrastructure support, and the necessity for reliable water supply in an urban center like Caesarea during this period, I expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present in Yehuda.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity called the Proto-French Kingdom would have had a Drinking Water Supply System based on its historical context. The period is between 987 CE and 1150 CE. 

First, I should understand what the Proto-French Kingdom was. From what I remember, it's an artificial state that historians created to study medieval polities. It's not a real country but used as a model for analyzing European kingdoms during the Middle Ages.

Now, thinking about drinking water supply systems: these usually involve specialized buildings where drinking water is treated and supplied to the population. The presence of such systems depends on factors like economic class, urbanization, and political structure.

The Proto-French Kingdom was likely an agrarian state with a feudal system. Many medieval states had some form of water management because they relied heavily on agriculture. They often built monasteries orcellars to store and preserve water, which would be essential for crops.

Also, considering the proto-state's size and complexity between 987 and 1150 CE, it might have been possible to centralize water supply systems as their population grew. Urbanization in this period often brought people into contact with better infrastructure, including water sources.

However, not all polities had such systems; some were more isolated or less advanced. But the Proto-French model was designed as a typical medieval state, so it's reasonable to assume they would have had some form of drinking water system, maybe through cellars or decentralized supply networks.

So putting this together, I think the Proto-French Kingdom would expect to have a Drinking Water Supply System present.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System (DWS) was present in the French Kingdom during the Late Capetian period between 1150 CE and 1328 CE. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the French Kingdom under the Capets was a significant political entity, but it didn't last forever. The period from 1150 to 1328 covers several key events and transformations in the region. So, I should consider factors like urbanization, social structures, governance, and maybe the influence of neighboring regions.

I remember that during the Middle Ages, especially in France, water supply systems were crucial for agriculture and daily life. The DWS would involve specialized buildings, like water towers or reservoirs, which were often state-owned. So, if a polity had such infrastructure, it's more likely to be present.

Looking at the time frame, 1150 CE is after the decline of the County of Reims and before the Hundred Years' War (which started in 1337). The Capetians were consolidating their power against the Normans. By the mid-12th century, they had a centralized kingdom under Charles V, then later under his son, Odo of France.

I also recall that in medieval times, towns often had their own water systems to ensure access to fresh water, especially as urbanization increased. For example, places like Aquitaine and Normandy had well-established drainage systems. However, the French Kingdom as a whole might have had varying levels of infrastructure depending on the region.

The state owned property was common in medieval governance. Towns would often hire officials to manage water supplies, so it's plausible that the central government would invest in such systems to provide reliable water for the entire kingdom. This would help maintain public order and support the growing population.

Another point is the political stability during this period. The Capetians were able to maintain a relatively stable polity against external threats like the Normans, which might have allowed them to invest in infrastructure without constant fear of rebellion or internal strife.

However, I should also consider economic factors. If the region was predominantly agricultural and water was abundant in some areas but scarce in others, it could complicate the development of a centralized water supply system. But given that the kingdom covered a large area including modern-day France, Burgundy, and parts of Germany, having a network to manage water distribution across such a vast territory would have been essential for logistical efficiency.

I also think about technological advancements during this time. While not as advanced as in later periods, medieval engineering was still capable of building structures like dikes, canals, and reservoirs. The need to supply both urban and rural areas would drive the development of such systems.

Additionally, if the kingdom had a centralized bureaucracy or government, it could coordinate these systems effectively. Town governance might have been more decentralized, but the central authority likely provided the necessary infrastructure.

Looking at historical sources, I'm not sure about specific records on water supply systems in this period, but there are mentions of waterways and drainage systems in various parts of what is now France. The existence of a DWS would make sense if the kingdom was expanding its administrative capacity to meet population growth and economic needs.

In conclusion, considering the time frame, political stability, economic activities, and governance structures, it seems likely that the French Kingdom during the Late Capetian period did have a Drinking Water Supply System present. The central government's resources would support such an infrastructure for the benefit of the entire polity.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Carolingian Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on my knowledge of their history. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Carolingian Empire.

The Carolingian Empire existed from 752 CE until its destruction in 840 CE. It was centered around the Merovingian dynasty, which included several Carolots, each ruling for a time. The empire was relatively small and fragmented after the death of Charles Martel, who was overthrown by his cousin Pepin the Short in the late 700s.

I remember that during the Carolingian period, there were periods of relative peace and prosperity, especially under the coronation of Pepin the Short as emperor in 804. Pepin is often seen as a unifying figure who tried to bring together different parts of his fractious empire.

Now, thinking about drinking water systems. I know that in medieval times, especially in larger polities or kingdoms, having an organized water supply system would have been essential for maintaining infrastructure and ensuring access to potable water for both the elite and the common people. They might have had aqueducts, reservoirs, and filtration systems.

But wait, the Carolingian Empire was a small empire. So perhaps they didn't need as extensive a system because their population wasn't as large or as spread out. However, during Pepin's reign, the empire was unified again after 771 when he reorganized it under his brotherbert, which might have led to some centralized governance that could support infrastructure.

I also recall that in many medieval monarchies, especially those with a strong central authority, water supply systems were sometimes less developed compared to city-states or more extensive states. But on the other hand, even small empires often had basic infrastructure because they needed it for daily life, trade, and defense.

Another point is that during the Carolingian period, there was significant emphasis on centralized administration. The Carolots were known for their reforms, like the law code of Aedas in 769 under Clovis I, which promoted order and efficiency. Centralized governance would likely support systems that aid in governance and resource management.

But then again, if the empire was small, maybe they didn't invest as much in such infrastructure because it wasn't as critical for their economy or defense as it might have been for a larger state. They were more focused on military campaigns, which require more resources than just providing water.

So, putting this together: The Carolingian Empire existed long enough that some systems could develop and function. Pepin's reign brought stability, but the empire wasn't huge. Therefore, perhaps a Drinking Water Supply System was present during his time and maybe in other periods too. But I'm not entirely sure if it was consistently present throughout their entire existence or only during certain periods.

Alternatively, considering that many Carolingian towns had their own water systems before they became part of the empire, but when they were centralized under Pepin, perhaps those local systems continued or even expanded. So maybe a system existed at least in parts of the empire for much of its duration.
</think>

The Carolingian Empire's history suggests that a Drinking Water Supply System was likely present during certain periods, particularly under Pepin the Short's reign when centralization and stability were achieved. While smaller in scale compared to larger polities, the empire invested enough resources into infrastructure due to the necessity for daily life, trade, and defense. Thus, while not universal throughout their entire existence, such systems were present at least during key periods, including under Pepin.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System was present in Yisrael between 1030 BCE and 722 BCE. First, I should recall what Yisrael is—it's another name for the Kingdom of Israel, right? It existed from around 1458 BCE when Solomon founded it until its destruction by the Babylonians around 722 BCE.

Now, I'm trying to remember if there was any system in place for providing drinking water during that time. From what I know about ancient civilizations, especially those that were more urbanized or had growing populations, they often needed reliable water supplies. The Babylonians, for example, had a well system, but Yisrael is a different story.

I think about the construction of cities like Jerusalem around 586 BCE after the fall of the First Temple. I remember there was talk about building reservoirs to ensure water supply during dry seasons. But were these reservoirs actually built? There's some debate on that point because while plans existed, execution might have been incomplete or forgotten.

Also, considering the resources available at the time, maybe they relied more on natural sources like rivers and perhaps even wells. If Yisrael was part of a larger empire temporarily, like under Babylonian rule, their systems would have been different, but after the fall of Babylonian control around 539 BCE, they went back to being an independent kingdom.

Another angle is looking at historical texts or inscriptions. Are there any records mentioning reservoirs, water towers, or well systems? I'm not sure if such details are preserved in ancient texts for Yisrael specifically. The Dead Sea Scrolls and other biblical texts might have some allusions, but specifics about infrastructure like water supply systems aren't always clear.

Additionally, the Israelites were known for their agriculture—Jewel of the East comes to mind. They relied heavily on farming, so they probably had irrigation systems as well. But irrigation is different from a centralized drinking water supply system.

I also think about trade routes and how resources were transported in ancient times. If there was a need to ensure consistent water supply for cities or religious sites, like the Temple, then such a system would have been important. But again, I don't recall specific evidence of that happening.

In summary, while there might have been plans for better water management during certain periods, there's no clear indication from historical records that Yisrael had an actual Drinking Water Supply System in place between 1030 BCE and 722 BCE. So, perhaps it was absent.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS) was present in the Deccan Iron Age polity between 1200 BCE and 300 BCE. I'm not too familiar with this period or region, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I know that the Deccan refers to modern-day Maharashtra and parts of Karnataka in India. The Iron Age in India is a significant period, often associated with the Sangam literature from around 200 BCE to 500 CE. However, the question specifies between 1200 BCE and 300 BCE, which seems earlier than the commonly known Sangam period.

I recall that during the Iron Age in India, there was a shift towards larger regional polities as opposed to individual kingdoms. This period saw the emergence of powerful states like the Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE), the Kalinga Empire, and eventually the Gupta Empire (4th to 6th century CE). But these are later periods compared to the one specified in the question.

Now, considering that the Deccan might have been part of various kingdoms or polities during this time, I should think about whether such regions had centralized water systems. I know that ancient India had a network of rivers and wells, with the Harappans (around 3300 BCE–2575 BCE) being one of the earliest urban cultures who had access to water from the Indus River. However, the Harapans were more in the north, not Deccan.

Looking into the regional history, the Deccan region probably saw various kingdoms and empires come and go. If there was a centralized polity during that time, it might have had infrastructure like DWSS. But if it was a decentralized system with local rulers, maybe it didn't need a state-owned supply system.

Another angle is the role of rivers in the Deccan region. The Tapti River, for instance, flows through parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. If the polity relied heavily on river water, they might not have had as much need for a controlled supply system unless there was regulation or management needed to ensure access.

I'm also thinking about technological advancements. If the period in question was around 1200 BCE–300 BCE, it's possible that primitive technologies were being used. Without written records from this specific time, it's hard to say definitively whether a DWSS existed. But considering the later development of urban planning and administrative systems by the Maurya Empire (which started around 322 BCE), maybe the Deccan didn't have such systems before that.

Moreover, the absence of written records or archaeological evidence from this specific period makes it challenging to confirm the presence or absence of a DWSS. However, if we consider that many regions were under the control of larger empires during this time, those empires might have had infrastructure in place to manage water supplies centrally.

In summary, without concrete evidence, I'm leaning towards the absence of a Drinking Water Supply System because earlier periods might not have required such centralized systems. However, the possibility exists that as empires rose and fell within the Deccan region during this time, they might have had some form of system, either owned by or managed through local communities.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Middle Formative Basin of Mexico between 800 BCE and 401 BCE. I'm not super familiar with this region, but I remember that the Middle Formative Period is part of the Pre-Columbian history in Mexico, along with the Aztec and Pre-Aztec civilizations.

First, I should think about what the Middle Formative Basin entailed historically. It was a period of significant cultural development, agriculture, and urbanization, especially in regions like the Valley of Mexico. People were cultivating crops such as corn (tecal in Spanish) for food, which suggests that there was some form of sustenance system.

Now, considering drinking water supply systems, I'm aware that many early civilizations had some form of water management. For example, the Aztecs built reservoirs and used canals to manage water supply. However, the Middle Formative Period might have been a bit earlier than the Aztec period, so maybe their systems were simpler or different.

I also recall that during this time, there was significant agricultural activity, which would require water for irrigation. Without a proper system, farming could become difficult because of droughts or lack of consistent water sources. So it's plausible that some form of water supply was present to support the growing population and expanding settlements.

Additionally, trade with neighboring regions might have necessitated access to reliable water sources, especially as settlements grew larger. If there were issues with water scarcity, people would likely develop ways to manage or retrieve water more effectively.

On the other hand, I'm not sure if the term ""drinking water supply system"" specifically refers to something like a municipal water supply with buildings and infrastructure. It might just mean whether the polity had control over water resources in general. If so, it's possible that they did have systems in place, especially considering their agricultural focus.

I should also consider the possibility of water being sourced from natural sources or trade networks. If the region was part of a larger trade network, perhaps through which goods and water were transported, then having some form of water management would be necessary to support that.

In summary, given the agricultural intensity and urbanization during the Middle Formative Period, it seems reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System would have been present. The need for consistent water sources aligns with the demands of farming and supporting a growing population.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS) was present in Norway II during its time, which was between 1262 CE and 1396 CE. 

First, I should understand what a DWSS is. From the question, it's defined as polity-owned specialized buildings or systems for providing drinking water, either owned by the community or the state. So, if the polity had a system to provide safe drinking water, maybe through public buildings like reservoirs, purification plants, or distribution networks, then it would be present.

Now, Norway II was a kingdom in medieval Europe, right? It's important to think about the time period: from 1262 to 1396. That covers several centuries, including parts of the Middle Ages and early Renaissance. 

I know that many medieval kingdoms had systems for water supply because it was crucial for daily life, agriculture, and hygiene. For example, castles often had their own water sources to avoid contamination from nearby rivers or to ensure a steady supply. Also, the Church in medieval times often played a role in providing water through monasteries or other religious sites.

But wait, Norway II might be a bit different because it's an island kingdom and perhaps geographically isolated. If the area is remote, maybe they had fewer resources for such systems. But then again, having a DWSS wouldn't necessarily depend on being near other regions; it's more about having infrastructure to handle water.

I should also consider if there were any notable changes or innovations in water supply during that period. For instance, the invention of better filtration techniques or reservoirs could have been introduced. However, I'm not sure if such technological advancements were widespread across Europe at that time.

Another angle is looking at neighboring polities. If other kingdoms nearby had DWSS, it's possible Norway II might have as well, especially if they were part of a network or if there was some central authority. But if Norway II was isolated and didn't integrate with other regions' systems, maybe the need wasn't as acute.

Also, considering the role of the state versus the community: if the kingdom had a government that valued public health and infrastructure, they might have built such a system. Private communities sometimes did as well, but it's more common for the state to provide services like this, especially in larger polities.

I should think about specific examples from that period. For instance, in medieval Europe, towns often built their own water towers or reservoirs. If Norway II was a large enough area, they might have had systems to manage water efficiently. However, if it's a smaller or more isolated place, maybe the DWSS wasn't as developed.

Wait, but Norway at that time is part of Scandinavia, which has a long history with Bergen Cathedral and other religious sites providing water. Maybe there was a tradition in the region for using such systems through monasteries or churches. So perhaps Norway II would have had access to some form of DWSS without explicitly having a polity-owned system.

Alternatively, maybe they didn't develop such infrastructure because of limited resources or economic factors at the time. If the kingdom relied on trade with mainland Europe, which might be more accessible for water supplies, but if it was cut off due to war or natural disasters, that could affect their ability to have a DWSS.

I'm also thinking about public health standards. In medieval times, water wasn't always treated properly, leading to diseases and bad hygiene. So having a DWSS would help ensure cleaner water, which is crucial for both personal and communal use.

But without specific historical records indicating that Norway II had such a system, it's hard to say definitively. However, given the time period and the nature of medieval polities, I might lean towards expecting some form of DWSS, possibly integrated into their governance or religious infrastructure.
</think>

The question asks whether Norway II, an island kingdom existing between 1262 CE and 1396 CE, would have had a Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS). Based on the analysis, it is reasonable to expect that such a system was present. 

During this period, many medieval kingdoms developed water supply systems due to the critical importance of clean water for daily life, agriculture, and health. Norway II's isolation might suggest less need for external supplies, but the region's proximity to religious sites like Bergen Cathedral likely provided access to pre-existing water sources that could be utilized effectively. Additionally, the kingdom may have integrated such systems into its governance or relied on communal efforts, as evidenced by other medieval polities. Therefore, it is expected that Norway II had a DWSS present during its time.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Early A'chik between 1775 CE and 1867 CE. I'm not very familiar with their history, but I can try to break this down.

First, I know that the period from 1775 to 1867 is roughly the late 18th to mid-19th century. This was a time when many countries were undergoing significant changes, including shifts in governance and infrastructure development. The presence of such a system would likely depend on factors like economic stability, government policies, and regional needs.

Early A'chik's exact location isn't specified, but given the time period, it might be somewhere in Asia or perhaps Europe, as these regions often had significant polities during that era. However, without more info, I have to make some educated guesses based on historical trends.

I recall that many civilizations and empires during this period did develop systems for water supply, especially if they were agrarian societies where water was essential for agriculture. Towns and cities often built specialized buildings or infrastructure to manage water supplies, such as reservoirs, canals, or filtration systems. For example, the Mesoamerican cities like Teotihuacan had elaborate systems around that time.

On the other hand, some regions might not have needed such a system if they were predominantly settled by nomadic tribes without large-scale agriculture. In those cases, water might be more accessible from natural sources or seasonal rains, reducing the need for specialized infrastructure.

Also, government policies play a role. If the polity was centralized and had resources to invest in infrastructure, it's more likely that a Drinking Water Supply System would exist. Conversely, if there was political instability or limited funding, such systems might not be developed.

I'm also thinking about technological advancements of the time. The 18th and early 19th centuries saw improvements in water filtration techniques, which could have contributed to the establishment of more reliable water supply systems. However, these technologies might have been too expensive or complex for smaller polities without significant resources.

Another angle is the population size and density. A densely populated area would likely require better water management systems to meet the growing demand, whereas sparsely populated regions might not need as much infrastructure.

I should also consider any conflicts or wars during this period that could disrupt or erase existing systems. If Early A'chik was a unified polity but went through periods of war and rebuilding, they might have invested in such systems to ensure continuity of water supply for their settled populations.

In summary, without specific information about Early A'chik's geography, economy, governance, and population density, it's challenging to definitively say whether they had a Drinking Water Supply System. However, given the general trends of that era towards developing infrastructure for sustenance and the potential influence of centralized governance in polities of that time, I might lean toward expecting the presence of such a system.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question defines the absence or presence based on whether specialized buildings owned by the polity exist for water supply. If Early A'chik was similar to many ancient city-states or empires during that period, they probably did have such systems. However, if their society was more agrarian and settled without large urban centers, maybe not.

Alternatively, considering the time frame overlaps with European colonial periods in some regions, which often saw urban planning and infrastructure developments, but again, this is speculative.

I think I'll go with 'present' because many polities of that era likely developed such systems, especially if they were settled communities relying heavily on water for sustenance.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Achaemenid Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on their history. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that the Achaemenids were situated in what's now Iran, part of Persia. They were a powerful empire after Alexander the Great, right? He was killed in 323 BCE and his general, Darius I, took over.

Darius really expanded the empire; I remember he went as far north as the Euphrates River. His son Cyrus the Great expanded even more into the Medesia region. But after Darius's death, Cyrus's son Xerxes I was the next king. He was killed around 321 BCE by his own general, and then his successor, Artaxerxes I, took over. That's when the empire reached its peak in about 330-325 BCE.

Wait, the time frame here is from 550 BCE to 331 BCE. So that includes Xerxes I's reign as well. But then after his death, Darius I's successor was Cyrus the Younger. He established the Persian Empire in 331 BCE and continued to expand until his death in 307 BCE.

But wait, the question is about the Achaemenid Empire between 550 and 331 BCE. So that includes both the time after Alexander's death up until when Cyrus took over? Or is it referring specifically to Darius's empire?

I think the Achaemenid name refers more to Darius's dynasty, right? Because after Cyrus, it became the Achaemenid Empire. So between 550 BCE and 331 BCE would cover both the time of Darius I (550-329 BCE) and Xerxes I (324-321 BCE), with the peak around 330-325 BCE.

So, considering that these were periods when empires were vast and had significant administrative structures. ADrink Water Supply System would likely involve specialized buildings like reservoirs, maybe granaries for water storage, and perhaps even systems to bring water from distant sources or manage it within the empire's needs.

I'm trying to remember if ancient empires typically had such systems. From what I recall, large empires did have elaborate infrastructure because they needed resources efficiently. The Persians were known for their engineering skills—buildings like the Pyramid of Giza and other monumental structures suggest a well-organized society with resources managed effectively.

Moreover, in times of war or economic shifts, having a reliable water supply would be crucial to maintain stability and support populations. So even during times when empires expanded, they probably maintained such systems to keep their administration smooth.

I don't remember any specific instances where the Achaemenid Empire lacked such systems. In fact, considering their scale and administrative complexity, it's quite plausible that they did have a Drinking Water Supply System in place.

Wait, but what about periods of conflict? Would that affect the presence of such systems? Well, empires would need reliable water supplies regardless because they were large and had populations to sustain. They might have adapted or maintained systems even during wars by rationing or sourcing from other regions if necessary.

So putting it all together: The Achaemenid Empire was a vast and complex polity with significant administrative needs. Given their infrastructure, including engineering expertise, it's reasonable to expect that they had a Drinking Water Supply System in place between 550 BCE and 331 BCE.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity called Late A'chik had a Drinking Water Supply System between 1867 CE and 1956 CE. First, I should understand what the drinking water supply system entails. It's about whether there are specialized buildings for water supply—like reservoirs, purification plants, or distribution systems—owned by the polity, either through their community or government.

I know that many ancient and medieval polities developed sophisticated infrastructure because access to clean water was crucial for health, agriculture, and daily life. For example, cities like Mesopotamia had elaborate water supply systems well before recorded history. However, not all polities went this far; some might have relied on simpler solutions like using local wells or relying on natural sources.

Late A'chik is a historical period between 1867 and 1956 CE. I'm not exactly sure who Late A'chik refers to because that name doesn't ring a bell in my knowledge. It might be a fictional polity for the purpose of this question, or it could refer to a specific region in history. Without more context, I have to make some educated guesses based on general historical trends.

Assuming Late A'chik is an ancient city-state or similar political entity, it's likely that they would invest in infrastructure necessary for sustenance and health. Clean water was essential not just for drinking but also for agriculture, which supports a significant portion of the population. Therefore, it's plausible that they had systems to ensure access to clean water.

Moreover, many polities during this period saw the importance of water management as part of their development and governance. They might have built reservoirs to store water, especially in regions with inconsistent rainfall or river flows. Water purification systems could also be present if they faced issues like contaminated water sources from trade routes or natural disasters.

However, not all polities were equally developed. Factors like geography, resources, and political stability would influence whether such a system existed. If Late A'chik was situated in an arid region where clean water was scarce but managed through local wells or rainwater collection systems, they might have functioned without specialized buildings.

But given the time frame spans over 90 years, it's possible that advancements in technology allowed for more efficient water supply systems. Maybe by 1956, they had moved towards a more centralized system with reservoirs and treatment facilities.

In conclusion, considering historical trends towards infrastructure development for sustenance and health, and without specific reasons to believe Late A'chik was in an arid or isolated environment, it's reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System would be present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Mahajanapada era, which was between 600 BCE and 324 BCE. I'm not too familiar with the history of that period, but I know it's an important part of Indian history, related to the Maurya Empire.

First, I remember that the Maurya Empire was one of the most powerful in ancient India, known for its administrative efficiency. They were a well-organized polity, so it makes sense that they would have systems to manage resources like water supply effectively.

I'm trying to recall if they had something specific for drinking water. From what I remember, in ancient times, especially during empires, they often built grand cities with elaborate infrastructure. They might have had reservoirs, canals, and maybe even centralized water management systems. I think places like the Indus Valley had advanced drainage systems, so maybe the Mauryans did something similar.

I also think about the role of kings in such empires. Kings would probably have control over resources to maintain their power and ensure that the people were well-fed, especially during wars or times of crisis. If they controlled water supply, it would be part of their administration to manage the population's needs.

But I'm not sure if a ""Specialized Building"" like a reservoir was considered a Drinking Water Supply System in their classification. They might have had palaces with private water systems for the elite, but maybe that wasn't considered a public supply system owned by the polity as a whole.

Wait, I think the Maurya Empire did build cities like Kosala and Kandahar, which were known for being well-planned. These cities might have had infrastructure including water management features. So it's possible they had some form of centralized water supply to ensure access throughout the empire.

I should also consider if there are any historical texts or sources that mention drinking water systems during this period. The Arthashastra by Kautilya is a source I remember reading about governance and administration, including water management as part of sustainable development practices for a polity.

Putting it all together, while I'm not entirely sure if they had the exact term ""Drinking Water Supply System,"" their infrastructure and administrative systems would likely have included ways to manage water access. So my initial thought is that it was present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Mughal Empire had a drinking water supply system in place. The Mughal Empire was a vast empire that existed from around 1526 CE to 1858 CE under successive sultans. They were known for their extensive network of canals and rivers, especially the Yamuna River, which is the source of their drinking water.

First, I should consider how the Mughals obtained their water. The Yamuna flows through their empire, so access to fresh water was crucial for drinking, agriculture, and trade. They likely used this natural resource efficiently given their vast territories. 

Next, the structure of their administration: the Mughal Empire had a decentralized system with various regional rulers (Nizam) who were responsible for local administration. These Nizams would have been in charge of managing resources like water within their domains. So, it's plausible that they had systems to manage and distribute drinking water.

Additionally, the empire covered a large area across India, which includes several states with distinct cultures and needs. It makes sense that having a centralized or decentralized water management system would help ensure access for all regions. 

I should also think about other empires of similar size from around the same period. For example, the Mughal Empire was comparable in size to the Ottomans (Khanate), which did have elaborate systems for resource distribution, including water. The Ottomans had a well-organized bureaucracy and infrastructure, so it's reasonable that the Mughals would follow suit.

Moreover, since the Mughals were known for their architectural and engineering feats, they probably built infrastructure to manage water supplies effectively. This might include canals, reservoirs, and distribution networks to ensure a steady supply of drinking water across their empire.

However, I should also consider any potential challenges. Large empires often struggle with resource management due to internal conflicts, political changes, or environmental issues. The Mughal Empire faced significant governance challenges under successive rulers, which might have affected the maintenance of such systems. But even so, having a basic water supply system would likely be necessary for survival and administration.

In conclusion, given their geographic size, reliance on natural resources like the Yamuna, decentralized governance with regional rulers responsible for local administration, and comparison to other empires, it's reasonable to expect that the Mughal Empire did have a Drinking Water Supply System in place.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Vijayanagara Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on its history from 1336 CE to 1646 CE. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Vijayanagara Empire was a significant South Indian dynasty, part of the Deccan Sultanate in India. It was known for its powerful military and administration during its peak around the 15th century. But I'm not sure about their infrastructure, including water supply systems.

I think about other empires from that period. The Mughals, who were also in the region, had advanced systems withountains and wells maintained by professionals. The Vijayanagars might have had similar infrastructure since they were a powerful polity. They probably needed reliable water for irrigation, drinking, and transportation of goods.

Looking into their administrative structure, the dynasty was known for its decentralized governance with local rulers (vijayachalamas) who were responsible for maintaining law and order. If they controlled so many areas, managing a centralized water supply system would make sense to regulate water resources efficiently across the empire.

Also, considering their military might, having access to fresh water would be crucial forboth soldiers and civilians. Wars often necessitate reliable water sources to sustain troops during campaigns.

I recall that the Vijayanagara Empire faced several challenges like invasions from neighboring powers, which would require maintaining strong infrastructure to resist such threats. A robust drinking water system could help protect their society by ensuring a steady supply regardless of external pressures.

Moreover, the empire's economy was likely agrarian-heavy, so having an efficient irrigation system provided by reliable water sources would be essential for crop cultivation and thus the livelihood of many people.

So putting it all together, given their administrative structure, military needs, economic dependencies on agriculture, and the importance of maintaining control over resources, it seems plausible that the Vijayanagara Empire did have a Drinking Water Supply System.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Abbasid Caliphate had a Drinking Water Supply System in place based on their buildings or infrastructure. The time frame is from 750 CE to 946 CE.

First, I should recall what the Abbasid Caliphate was like historically. It was an Islamic empire that expanded a lot after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. They were known for their efficient administration and infrastructure development. The Abbasids inherited and improved upon the resources from the Persians and the Hawaiians, among others.

Hygiene and health were probably important to them because maintaining a healthy population was crucial for governance. They had cities like بغداد and Basra, which were centers of trade and culture. These cities would need reliable water supplies. So maybe they built water systems?

I remember that in many ancient civilizations, including the Greeks and Romans, they had sophisticated drainage systems and water management. The Abbasids might have followed similar practices to ensure access to clean water for their people.

Also, the Abbasid Caliphate was known for its urban planning; they organized cities into grids with canals and channels to manage water flow effectively. This kind of infrastructure would include systems for delivering water from sources like rivers or wells through these networks.

So putting it all together, considering their emphasis on governance, efficient resource management, and the need for a healthy population supported by clean drinking water, I would expect that they had a Drinking Water Supply System present.
</think>

The Abbasid Caliphate, established after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, was known for its efficient administration and infrastructure. Given their focus on maintaining a healthy population through proper hygiene and resource management, it is reasonable to conclude that they likely implemented a Drinking Water Supply System using specialized buildings, such as those with advanced drainage systems and organized urban planning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS) existed in the Early Dynastic period, which was between 2900 BCE and 2500 BCE. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that the Early Dynastic period is part of the broader Mesopotamian history, specifically around ancient Mesopotamia, which includes what's now Iraq. During this time, civilizations were developing, and there was a lot of focus on infrastructure because managing water resources would be crucial for agriculture, drinking, and overall daily life.

I remember that in ancient times, many civilizations built specialized structures like ziggurats or reservoirs to manage water supplies. For example, the Babylonians are known for their advanced drainage systems. If the Early Dynasties were similar, they might have had some form of DWSS.

Also, during this period, there was a shift towards centralization and state control over resources. The presence of a polity (which in ancient terms often referred to city-states or kingdoms) would likely mean that the state owned or controlled infrastructure like water systems. So it's plausible that such a system existed under their administration.

However, I'm not sure about specific examples from this exact period. It might be safer to consider if there were any known DWSS in nearby periods and assume they evolved similarly. If later Dynasties had advanced water systems, maybe the Early Dynasties did too.

Another point is that trade and agriculture require reliable water sources. Without a DWSS, maintaining populations would have been challenging, so it's likely such systems were present to support their growing cities and populations.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain if the term ""Drinking Water Supply System"" was specifically used in this period or if it evolved differently. Maybe the concept existed under different names or forms, which could affect my answer.

Overall, considering the need for water management during that time and the centralized nature of polities, I would lean towards expecting a DWSS to have been present.

iq_neo_babylonian_emp,present,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Neo-Babylonian Empire between 626 BCE and 539 BCE. First, I should understand what this system entails. It's about having special buildings where drinking water is provided, which could be by the state or owned by the community.

I know that the Neo-Babylonian Empire was a later period following the fall of the First and Second巴比伦 (Babylon) Kingdoms to Alexander the Great in 332 BCE. Their empire lasted until around 539 BCE when Cyaxeres III iii banned their culture but allowed them to continue under his rule, which actually extended it beyond Alexander's time.

Water supply systems were probably important for urban areas during this period because managing water was crucial for agriculture and daily life, especially in a region with significant agricultural activities. The ancient Near East had well-developed irrigation systems, so it makes sense that the Neo-Babylonians would have similar infrastructure to support their growing cities like Susa, Uruk, and Lagash.

The Babylonians themselves were known for their sophisticated city planning and water management systems before Alexander's conquest. They likely had specialized buildings where water was stored and distributed, such as ziggurats with reservoirs or houses that provided potable water through cisterns.

After Alexander's death in 332 BCE, the empire split into several successor states, including Persia under Cyrus the Great. However, the Neo-Babylonian Empire continued under Cyaxeres III and his descendants. It's plausible that they maintained or even improved their infrastructure systems, including water supply, as it was essential for their urban centers.

I also recall that in later periods of Mesopotamia, there were campaigns to restore and maintain such systems, especially after foreign rule ended. Since the Neo-Babylonians had control over a vast area, they likely invested in infrastructure projects like roads, canals, and water supply systems to support their growing population and agricultural needs.

Therefore, considering the importance of water during this time and the likely maintenance of infrastructure by the ruling class, I would expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity called Ubaid, which existed between 5500 BCE and 4201 BCE, had a Drinking Water Supply System. The system is defined as polity-owned structures that provide drinking water, either owned by the community or the state.

First, I should understand who Ubaid was. From what I remember, Ubaid is an ancient Polynesian settlement located off the coast of the Marshall Islands. It's known for its rich history in fishery and submarine basket weaving. The Ubaid culture dates back thousands of years, so it fits the time frame given here.

Now, considering the time period: 5500 BCE to 4201 BCE is around when human societies were developing complex systems. By 3000 BCE or so, many early civilizations had some form of water management because water was crucial for agriculture and daily life. The presence of a polity would likely require infrastructure like wells or pipes to provide clean drinking water.

Ubaid's society was small and highly collectivized, relying heavily on fishing and subsistence hunting. These activities didn't necessarily require large-scale water systems unless they were moving between isotopes or dealing with droughts. But given the time frame, it's possible that they had some system in place to manage water resources.

I don't recall specific details about Ubaid having a formal drinking water supply system from historical sources. However, without written records, it's hard to be certain. It might have been absent because of their reliance on natural resources rather than centralized systems.

So, putting it all together, while the time period suggests some level of complexity that might necessitate basic infrastructure, the specifics about Ubaid don't point to a Drinking Water Supply System being present.
</think>

The polity 'Ubaid', existing between 5500 BCE and 4201 BCE, is known for its reliance on fishing and submarine basket weaving. Although the time period suggests possible infrastructure development, there are no specific records indicating the presence of a Drinking Water Supply System. Ubaid's culture emphasized community living without centralized systems. Therefore, it is absent.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Parthian Empire II, which spanned from 41 CE to 226 CE. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with Parthian history, but I know they were a significant ancient empire in the region now known as Afghanistan. Let me try to break this down.

First, what exactly is a Drinking Water Supply System? It's defined as specialized buildings where drinking water is supplied, either owned by the polity or the community. So I'm thinking of things like wells, reservoirs, maybe even cities that had systems in place for delivering water efficiently.

I remember that in ancient empires, especially those with vast territories, managing resources like water must have been crucial because access to clean water is essential for drinking, cooking, and hygiene. The Parthians were known for their extensive networks of roads and infrastructure, so it's possible they had systems to supply water across their empire.

I also recall that empires often centralize their governance, which would mean assigning responsibilities like water supply to specific institutions or units within the polity. The Parthians had various provinces and administrative structures; maybe each province was responsible for its own water supply system.

Another point is that in many ancient civilizations, including some parts of what is now the Middle East and Central Asia, they built dams, aqueducts, and other engineering feats to manage water resources. If the Parthian Empire II extended into regions where such systems were common, it's plausible they had similar infrastructure.

I should also consider the time period: from 41 CE to 226 CE falls within the Roman-Romanization period in Afghanistan. After the Roman Empire fell, the area was under various foreign rule—Greco-Roman periods initially before becoming part of the Islamic Golden Age and then the Taliban era. During this time, empires often inherited or adapted existing systems from previous rulers.

Moreover, the Parthians were known for their efficient administration. They had a well-organized bureaucracy, which would have made setting up a drinking water supply system feasible. They might have integrated it into their urban planning and infrastructure development.

I'm also thinking about the decline of empires. Sometimes, as an empire grows too large or faces internal conflicts, they might cut back on certain systems to manage resources more efficiently. But I don't know if Parthian history shows a decline in water management during this specific period.

Wait, Parthian rule was relatively stable for a time after their initial instability. They were known for maintaining control over vast territories with efficient governance. So it's likely they would have invested in infrastructure like water supply systems to ensure the well-being of their people.

Also, considering similar empires in the region, such as the Kushan Empire or the Parthian Empire itself, which had a significant influence on later cultures, it seems reasonable that they would maintain systems for basic needs like drinking water.

In summary, given the strategic importance of water supply in ancient empires and the Parthians' organizational capabilities, I would expect that their polity during this period did have a Drinking Water Supply System present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Safavid Empire between 1501 CE and 1722 CE. First, let me recall what I know about the Safavid Empire. They were an Islamic dynasty in Iran, established by Shah Abbas Rezaoward in 1501. The empire lasted until it was overthrown in 1722.

I'm trying to remember if there were any significant developments or systems related to water supply during this period. I know that many empires have had infrastructure projects for water, irrigation, and sewage. For example, the Mesoamerican empires like the Aztecs built elaborate water systems. But Safavid was in a different region.

The Safavids were in Iran, which is pretty water-dependent. They might have needed reliable water supplies for agriculture, drinking, and perhaps urban areas. However, I'm not sure if they had a formalized system as we understand it today. Maybe they used local channels or natural resources like rivers.

I think the Qom Obsidian Aqueduct comes to mind. It was an impressive engineering feat from around 1605 CE, but that's after the Safavid period ended. So maybe by the time of their rule, water systems were becoming more advanced elsewhere in the region but perhaps not widespread enough within the empire itself.

Another point is that the Safavids might have been influenced by earlier Persian empires or neighboring ones like the Timurid Empire, which had extensive irrigation systems. But again, I'm not sure how much of that carried over into the Safavid era.

Also, considering the historical context, the empire faced challenges like invasions and internal strife, so maybe their focus was more on military and political aspects rather than infrastructure development.

So putting it all together, while water supply systems existed in other parts of the world during this time, I don't recall specific evidence of a Drinking Water Supply System specifically within the Safavid Empire itself. Therefore, my expectation is that such a system would be absent.
</think>

The drinking water supply system as we understand it may not have been present within the Safavid Empire during its tenure from 1501 to 1722 CE. While other regions saw advancements in water systems around this period, there's no specific evidence indicating a formalized drinking water supply system specifically within the empire itself. Therefore, the answer is:

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Sasanid Empire II had a Drinking Water Supply System. Hmm, first off, what do I know about the Sasanids? They were an Iranian empire that existed from around 488 CE until their fall in 651 CE. But wait, there's a specific period called Sasanid Empire II mentioned here—between 488 and 642 CE. So maybe it refers to either the early or mid-period of the empire.

I remember that empires vary a lot in how they obtained water resources. Some relied on rivers, some on wells, others on elaborate irrigation systems. The Sasanids were known for their vast empire, especially their territorial expansions after Cyrus the Great's reforms under Sassanid rule. But I'm not sure about their infrastructure.

I think that as empires expand, they develop better transportation and communication networks. Maybe they built canals or roads to manage water distribution more efficiently. Also, considering their size, having a centralized system for drinking water would make sense for organizational purposes. Water was essential for drinking, agriculture, and hygienic practices like washing.

But wait, the Sasanid Empire faced a lot of challenges. They were vulnerable to environmental issues due to deserts or harsh climates. Maybe that made access to reliable water harder. Also, the empire's political structure could affect the presence of such systems—if it was centralized under emperors who valued administration, they might invest in infrastructure.

Another angle is regional factors. Some areas might have had better natural resources than others. If the Sasanids focused on certain regions with abundant water sources, perhaps a Drinking Water Supply System wasn't as crucial there. But since their empire was so vast, maybe they had to develop such systems across different regions.

I'm not sure about specific records or texts from that time. Maybe historical accounts or inscriptions mention infrastructure developments around 600 CE. Alternatively, the fall of the Sasanids in 651 CE might have coincided with changes in water supply needs as empires declined.

Wait, I think that during their expansion, they might have built infrastructure to manage populations and trade routes, which could include drinking water systems. Also, emperors often promoted public buildings for administrative purposes, so having a Drinking Water Supply System would fit into that context.

On the other hand, if the empire was dealing with internal conflicts or governance issues, maybe resources were diverted elsewhere. Or perhaps the lack of consistent control made maintaining such a system difficult.

I'm leaning towards expecting the presence of a Drinking Water Supply System because empires in history often invest in infrastructure for sustainability and administration. Plus, considering their scale, it would be crucial to manage large populations.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the time when the Seleucid Empire was in place, which was between 312 BCE and 63 BCE. I'm not entirely sure about all the historical details, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I remember that the Seleucids were a Hellenistic dynasty, so they probably adopted many aspects of Greek culture and governance. Since they were a large polity covering places like Syria, Mesopotamia, and parts of Anatolia, they would have needed access to resources for their cities and administration.

I think about the role of water in ancient civilizations. In many places, especially in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions, access to a reliable water supply was crucial for drinking, irrigation, and, as a later point, for municipal services. The idea of specialized buildings like reservoirs or water towers might have been part of this system.

But wait, wasn't there something called ""kleros"" in some Hellenistic cities? I'm not sure if that's related to water supply. Also, the Seleucids were known for their administrative efficiency, so they might have had a system to manage resources effectively.

I also recall that the ancient Greeks often built systems like fountains and public water supply as part of city-states or empires. If the seleucids had cities similar in size and complexity to those Greek polities, it's plausible they would have such a system.

However, I'm not certain if this system was specifically called a ""drinking water supply system."" Maybe it was integrated into their broader infrastructure without being explicitly named as such. Also, considering the time period, did the Seleucids have the technology or resources to build and maintain such systems?

I should also think about other factors like climate. If the region had seasonal issues with water availability, a reliable supply system would be even more critical. The Seleucid Empire's geography might have made it easier to control water sources compared to other regions.

Another angle is whether neighboring polities or empires did have such systems and if that influenced the seleucids' approach. For example, if Caria or Persia had water supply systems during this period, maybe the seleucids adopted similar solutions after conquering their territories.

Wait, but the question specifically asks about the presence of a Drinking Water Supply System as per the defined criteria—specialized buildings owned by the polity (either community or state). So if the selukids didn't have such buildings, then it would be absent. But I think they did invest in infrastructure for their cities.

I'm also trying to remember if there are any historical records or sources that mention water supply systems during this period. Maybe some historians discuss the infrastructure of the selukid cities and suggest that they had advanced systems, possibly including water storage solutions.

However, without concrete evidence pointing specifically to a drinking water supply system being present, I might lean towards absent unless there's strong historical indication otherwise. Alternatively, considering their administrative structure and the resources available, it's more likely they did have such a system.

Wait, another thought: maybe the term ""drinking water supply system"" wasn't used in Seleucid times, but the concept existed under a different name. So if that's the case, perhaps the presence is still expected because the need was there and they might have adapted solutions, even if not named exactly as such.

But since I don't recall specific mentions of this term, maybe it's safer to say absent unless I'm certain about the systems they did have. Alternatively, considering their resources and governance needs, it's plausible that they had a system in place.

I think after all this consideration, I'll go with 'present' because despite not being explicitly named as such, the selukids likely had effective water management due to their size and administrative needs.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Seljuk Sultanate had a Drinking Water Supply System based on their history and social structures. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Seljuk Turks.

The Seljuk Turks were an important Turkic rulers that expanded from the 11th to the 14th century, ruling parts of Central Asia, Anatolia, the Caucasus, and the Middle East. They were known for their efficient administration and infrastructure. Their empire was quite large, stretching into modern-day Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and even some regions in the Middle East.

Now, thinking about the Seljuk Sultanate's history from 1037 to 1157 CE, they had a strong centralized government with well-defined administrative systems. They were known for their urban planning; many of their cities were meticulously planned with clear streets and maybe even water supply systems. The sultans often built palaces as centers of administration, which would naturally have access to utilities like water.

But wait, the Seljuk Turks were also known for their unique water management systems. They used something called ""dams"" along rivers, especially in regions where there was seasonal rainfall, to regulate and utilize water more effectively. For example, they had the Daryga dam in modern-day Georgia, which was a significant engineering feat.

However, I should consider whether these dam constructions were part of a broader drinking water supply system. They built infrastructure for irrigation and flood control, but does that translate directly to a dedicated water supply system for urban populations? The sultans might have had palaces with their own sources or perhaps relied on natural resources, which could include rivers and dams.

Additionally, the Seljuk Turks were influenced by the Islamic Golden Age, where advancements in engineering and urban planning were prominent. This likely included improvements in water systems to support both palaces and cities.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question defines a Drinking Water Supply System as specialized buildings owned by the polity or its community. So if the Seljuk Turks had infrastructure like dams, reservoirs, or maybe even cylindrical water towers (which are sometimes part of public supply systems), that could qualify.

However, I'm also thinking about the socio-economic factors. The Seljuk period saw a lot of urbanization and population growth in their cities. To support that, having a reliable water supply system would have been essential. If they built dams to control rivers, that might mean they were already using stored water which could act as a part of their overall water supply.

Another point is the role of rivers. The Seljuk Turks often relied on river systems for both drinking and irrigation. So maybe instead of a centralized supply system with buildings, they had more decentralized infrastructure relying on natural water sources.

Wait, but dams are part of a broader water management system, not necessarily a dedicated supply system from a single source. However, if the palaces or administrative centers used this water, it might have been considered as part of their public supply.

Also, considering other parts of the empire, like their use of copper and metal pipes for plumbing in their cities, which suggests they had systems to distribute water throughout urban areas. So maybe that's an indication of a Drinking Water Supply System.

Putting it all together, I think the Seljuk Sultanate likely did have a Drinking Water Supply System due to their engineering prowess and centralized administration that required reliable water sources for both palaces and cities.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Ostrogothic Kingdom had a Drinking Water Supply System based on my knowledge of their history. First, let me recall what I know about the Ostrogoths. They were a Germanic tribe that ruled the territories around modern-day Czech Republic and Slovakia between 489 CE and 554 CE. The period is roughly equivalent to the time when the Visigoths were active.

Now, considering their history, they were part of the Visigothic Empire during much of this time under the Merovingian dynasty. I remember that the Visigoths were known for their relatively advanced administrative systems and infrastructure. They had a well-organized governance structure, which often included specialized buildings like town halls or granaries.

The drinking water supply system is something related to infrastructure and governance structures. If the polity owned these systems, it would mean they had centralized control over water distribution through buildings and possibly a network of pipes. I think during their time under the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths might have inherited some of this infrastructure because the Visigoths were efficient in managing resources.

However, after 530 CE, when the Merovingian dynasty fell apart, many groups, including the Ostrogoths, turned to the Avars for help. The Avar invasions caused a lot of destruction and disrupted their infrastructure. So, by 554 CE, which is near the end of the Ostrogothic period, it's possible that the system was either already absent or in decline.

But I'm not sure if the drinking water supply system was present during their peak under the Merovingians. Maybe they built granaries and other buildings for storing resources, including water, but perhaps by 554 CE, after the Avar conquests, this system had broken down. Alternatively, maybe the shift to Avars meant a loss of centralized water management.

I also remember that during periods of war or invasions, polities often lost their infrastructure quickly. So it's possible that Ostrogoths didn't have such a system anymore by 554 CE because they were in a state of flux after facing external threats like the Avar incursions.
</think>

The Ostrogothic Kingdom likely lacked a Drinking Water Supply System by 554 CE. After losing support from the Merovingian dynasty and facing Avar invasions, their infrastructure, including any centralized water management systems, was disrupted. Thus, the system was absent during that time.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the drinking water supply system existed in the Republic of St. Peter II (Rome) between 904 CE and 1198 CE based on my knowledge of world history. Hmm, first, I need to understand what a drinking water supply system entails. From the question, it's defined as specialized buildings that the polity owns, whether by the community or the state. So if there were public buildings designated for providing water, like water towers, reservoirs, or filtration systems, then it would be present.

Now, thinking about the history of Rome around that time period. I know that in ancient times, especially under the Byzantine Empire, which includes a significant part of the period from 904 to 1198 CE (since the empire started after 395 AD), there were efforts to maintain infrastructure like water systems. The Byzantines often focused on maintaining and improving their cities' resources because they were heavily invested in infrastructure for defense, agriculture, and trade.

I recall that during the height of the Byzantine Empire, there was a strong emphasis on fortifications around the empire's territories, which included extensive ditches and walls to protect against invasions. Similarly, water systems might have been built near these locations or integrated into the urban planning to ensure access to clean water for both military purposes and civilian use.

Also, considering that the Republic of St. Peter II was a successor state after the last Greek emperor, Justinian I, who implemented major reforms including the famous ""Hydrodigita,"" a network of water channels built throughout the empire's territory. This project aimed to provide clean drinking water across the vast empire, which spanned from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean and beyond.

However, Justinian's empire was around 500 years after his time (he reigned from 527 to 565 CE), so it might not directly apply to the period of St. Peter II. But if we consider that the Byzantines continued similar projects under their rule, then having a drinking water supply system would make sense. They might have built reservoirs and filtration systems in major cities like Constantinople (now Istanbul) to ensure a reliable water supply.

Moreover, during the Middle Ages, many European cities had elaborate water systems, including tankages and filtration plants. If St. Peter II's polity was part of a larger empire that included these kinds of infrastructure, it would be reasonable to expect that they would have similar systems in their own territory, especially if they were focusing on urban development or military construction.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics regarding St. Peter II specifically. The Republic of St. Peter II was a successor to Justinian's empire and existed until 1198 CE under the Fatimids. The Fatimids, however, are known for their decline in water resources leading to the ""D概括 problem,"" where their capital had to rely heavily on wells due to scarcity. But the Fatimids might not have had as extensive a system as Justinian's.

So perhaps during St. Peter II's rule, around 904-1198 CE, the polity might have started implementing water systems again if there were resources or strategic reasons. However, considering the decline of Byzantine influence and the Fatimid period after Justinian's death in 565 CE until about 1261, it's possible that their focus shifted away from large-scale infrastructure projects like comprehensive drinking water systems.

Therefore, while Justinian's time had such systems, St. Peter II might not have continued with them if the empire's resources were diverted elsewhere or due to natural disasters and invasions. However, maybe the polity took steps to rebuild or introduce such systems as part of urban development during their rule.

Alternatively, it's possible that without significant investment in infrastructure, especially considering political changes and conflicts, a drinking water supply system might have been absent or not as extensive as during Justinian's time.

Wait, but St. Peter II was a republic, so maybe they didn't rely on the state to manage such systems as centrally as Justinian did. Instead, local governance might have taken over responsibility for water supplies, which could mean that the polity owned specialized buildings or systems through local efforts rather than a centralized one.

In summary, considering the time period and the nature of the polity (republic), it's plausible that they didn't maintain as comprehensive a drinking water supply system as Justinian's empire did. Therefore, I might lean towards 'absent' but with some hesitation because there could have been efforts depending on local needs or resources.

**Answer:**

Considering the historical context of the Republic of St. Peter II (Rome) during 904-1198 CE, it is reasonable to conclude that a drinking water supply system was likely **absent**. While Justinian I's empire under Byzantine rule had extensive water systems due to strategic and defensive needs, the Fatimids who succeeded him may have shifted their focus post-Justinian towards other priorities such as rebuilding from natural disasters or concentrating resources elsewhere rather than maintaining large-scale infrastructure. Additionally, as a republic, governance might have been decentralized, leading to localized management of water supplies rather than centrally owned specialized buildings.

Therefore, based on the evidence and historical context, the drinking water supply system was expected to be **absent** during this period.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System in Ravenna between 568 CE and 751 CE based on the information about its history as an Exarchate. First off, I know Ravenna is famous for being the birthplace of St. Augustine, but I don't recall if that's directly related to the water supply system.

I remember that the exarchate was a significant power center in the early Byzantine Empire, especially under Emperor Justinian I. During his reign, Justinian made some major infrastructure improvements across the empire. One of those was the construction of the Palatine Aqueduct starting around 527 CE. This was a massive project that brought water from outside the city to provide a reliable supply.

Now, Ravenna being part of this vast network would have had access to these aqueducts unless there were specific local regulations or systems in place. The presence of such a large infrastructure suggests that the Polity (the exarchate) probably had control over their drinking water supply through these channels. Also, the fact that Justinian was focused on improving the city's infrastructure indicates a well-organized system.

Another point is that during the 6th and 7th centuries, Ravenna was a hub for missionary activities by St. Augustine. Missions often require reliable water sources for清洗ing clothes or personal hygiene, so it's plausible that the exarchate would have ensured a dependable supply to support their communities effectively.

Putting this all together, I'm leaning towards the presence of a Drinking Water Supply System because the historical context of Ravenna as an exarchate under Justinian likely included infrastructure projects like aqueducts.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Late Roman Republic between 133 BCE and 31 BCE. Let's start by breaking down what this system is. It's defined as specialized buildings owned by the polity or the state, which supply drinking water. So, if such buildings existed in ancient Rome during that period, I should answer ""present""; otherwise, it would be ""absent.""

First, I'll think about when the Roman Republic was around. The Late Roman Republic is sometimes referred to as the Western Roman Empire from 27 BCE until its collapse in 476 CE. But in this case, we're focusing on the period between 133 BCE and 31 BCE, which falls within what's often called the ""Romanization Period"" of Italy, where Roman influence was beginning to take root.

I know that during the Roman Republic, cities were important centers of governance and administration. Many of these cities were well-developed with infrastructure to support their populations. For example, Rome itself had a complex network of roads, public buildings, and certainly some system for water supply because Rome is known as the ""City of the Flies,"" which implies efficient waste management, including sanitation and water systems.

But was there a dedicated Drinking Water Supply System? I think that in ancient times, cities often built infrastructure specifically for this purpose. For instance, they might have built reservoirs, aqueducts, or treatment plants to ensure a reliable water supply. The Romans were known for their engineering prowess, so it's plausible they would have had systems in place.

However, considering the Late Republic period, which is after the peak of the Roman Empire and before its decline, there could have been periods of instability that might affect infrastructure. But generally, even during times of change, cities maintained essential services like water supply because it was crucial for daily life.

I also recall that in some parts of Italy, especially under Roman rule, there were developments aimed at improving public health and sanitation, which would naturally include water systems. For example, the construction of watermills or reservoirs to manage local water supplies.

Additionally, while I'm thinking about infrastructure, it's important to note that during this period, the Roman Empire was expanding, but many cities in the newly conquered territories were also developing their own systems to serve their populations without relying solely on Rome. So, it's possible that these city-states or local polities would have their own Drinking Water Supply Systems.

I should also consider if there are any historical records indicating the presence of such systems during this time. The Roman legal code and other texts might provide clues, but my knowledge is limited to general historical contexts rather than specific records from each period.

In summary, considering the importance of water supply for daily life in ancient cities, and the fact that Romans were skilled engineers who would invest in infrastructure projects, it's reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present during the Late Roman Republic between 133 BCE and 31 BCE.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Middle Roman Republic between 264 BCE and 133 BCE. Let's break this down.

First, I know that the Middle Roman Republic is an intermediate stage between the early Republic (509–27 BCE) and the Hellenistic period (135–39 BCE). So it spans about a thousand years, from roughly 264 BCE to 133 BCE. That's after the First Triumvirate and before Augustus became emperor.

Now, drinking water supply systems typically involve specialized buildings where water is treated or distributed, like reservoirs, wells, or filtration systems. I remember that in ancient Rome, especially during the Hellenistic period when this time frame overlaps, they had extensive water systems. For example, Alexandria had a major aqueduct system, which was impressive.

But wait, the Middle Roman Republic is before Augustus, so it's more like the late Republic and early Empire. During the late Republic, cities might have started developing their own water supplies to reduce dependence on distant sources. They would build reservoirs for drinking, cooking, and washing.

Also, during this period, there was a trend towards centralized governance. The polity likely had control over such infrastructure because it's part of maintaining city functionality. So the presence of specialized buildings for water supply makes sense as they built them to ensure reliability.

I should also consider if there were any known examples in that time frame. I think some Italian city-states around that period did start building their own water systems, so it wasn't a phenomenon unique to larger polities like Alexandria.

Putting this together, the Middle Roman Republic would have expected a Drinking Water Supply System because of the growing need for reliable water sources and centralized administration favoring infrastructure development.
</think>

The Middle Roman Republic, existing from approximately 264 BCE to 133 BCE, would have expected a Drinking Water Supply System. This expectation is rooted in the need for reliable water sources and the trend towards centralized governance, which facilitated the establishment of specialized infrastructure such as reservoirs and filtration systems.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Inca Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on their polity structure. The question defines such a system as specialized buildings owned by the polity—either individually or collectively. 

First, I remember that the Incas were a large empire known for their engineering feats and efficient administration. They built cities with intricate road systems like the Inca Road, which connected different regions. This suggests they had advanced infrastructure.

I also recall that the Inca Empire was highly centralized. The emperor held significant control over all aspects of governance, including infrastructure development. Since water supply is crucial for agriculture and daily life, especially in high-altitude regions where farming requires good irrigation systems, it makes sense that the empire would invest in such systems.

The Incas had cities like Cuzco (now Lima) at the base of their empire, which was a hub with walls to regulate access. They likely had infrastructure projects around these cities for water distribution. Given their organizational structure and the complexity of managing such a vast empire, building a reliable water supply system would have been essential.

Additionally, while I don't know specific examples from historical records about their water systems, there's no strong evidence suggesting they were absent. Instead, many emperors made significant infrastructure investments, which might include water systems to support the growing population and expanding territories.

So, putting it all together, it seems reasonable to expect that the Inca Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System as part of their polity.
</think>

The Incas, with their centralized authority and emphasis on infrastructure for governance, likely implemented a Drinking Water Supply System. Their extensive road networks and agricultural demands suggest an investment in reliable water systems, though specific records are scarce.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Republic of St. Peter I had a Drinking Water Supply System. I don't know much about this polity, but let's break down what I know.

First, the Republic of St. Peter I existed from 752 CE to 904 CE. That's over a thousand years, so it was a long-lasting polity. Now, I'm trying to recall if such historical periods usually had access to reliable drinking water or not.

I think many ancient and medieval civilizations faced challenges with providing safe and adequate drinking water. Often, they would have to rely on natural sources like rivers, wells, or rainwater. But in some cases, especially in urban areas, they might have built infrastructure for供水 systems.

The question defines a Drinking Water Supply System as something polity owns—either by the community or the state. So if there was a government-owned system, it would be present; otherwise, absent.

St. Peter I is named after Saint Petersburg, which today is part of Russia. The city of St. Petersburg has a long history, and I recall that in modern times, it's known for its efficient water supply systems. But does this apply to the medieval period?

In medieval times, especially during the height of the Russian Empire or earlier periods, there were likely attempts to improve public health through better sanitation and water supplies. However, it's possible that at the time, the infrastructure wasn't as advanced as we have today.

I'm not sure if St. Peter I specifically had a system. Maybe their governance didn't prioritize such systems back then, especially in rural areas or under different leaders. Alternatively, perhaps they did have some system but it's unclear from general historical knowledge.

Given that the time frame is over a thousand years ago and these kinds of systems develop slowly, it's possible that by 904 CE, there was no organized water supply system yet, or maybe one existed in part but wasn't owned by the polity as a whole.

I should also consider if any empires or regions around that time had such systems. For example, the medieval period saw various improvements in water supply, especially with the construction of reservoirs and canals. However, specific details about St. Peter I might be lacking from my knowledge.

So, weighing these factors, it's possible that during St. Peter I's existence, there wasn't a Drinking Water Supply System present as per their definition. Therefore, I would lean towards 'absent.'

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Republic of Venice III had a Drinking Water Supply System. From what I remember, the Republic of Venice was a significant European polity that existed from 1204 to 1563 CE. I know they were known for their merchant marine and maritime trade, but I'm not sure about their infrastructure systems like drinking water.

First, I'll consider the time period. The Republic of Venice III started in 1204, which was after the Italian Wars (1394-1458), so they were relatively isolated at first. After that, they became a major maritime power. But did they invest in infrastructure like drinking water systems?

I recall that many early modern states focused on military and economic development rather than modern infrastructure unless it was directly related to their economy or security. Venice had a strong navy, which required them to have access to fresh water for sailors and ships. They probably built riverside towns with dockyards, which would necessitate proper water supply systems.

Also, the Republic of Venice III was known for its trade in goods like glassware, silk, and spices from East Asia. These goods might require preservation, possibly using saltwater brines or other methods that could involve water usage. But I'm not sure if they had a dedicated system.

Looking into historical records, Venice had systems to supply water to their cities through rivers like the Doge's River (the canale del doge) and the Grand Canal. However, these were more for transportation than as a drinking supply system. They might have used these channels for irrigation or for public use but didn't necessarily have a specialized building dedicated solely to providing drinking water.

Additionally, during the 15th and 16th centuries, Venice was facing challenges like saltwater intrusion into their rivers, which affected their water systems. This would have required them to manage water supply carefully, possibly through infrastructure developments.

But I'm not certain if they had a ""drinking water supply system"" as defined in the question, which includes specialized buildings owned by the polity or the community. It's possible that while they did have riverside infrastructure for trade and navigation, there wasn't an explicit building designated solely for providing drinking water to the entire polity.

Therefore, considering their focus on military, trade, and maritime activities without a dedicated emphasis on a separate drinking water supply system, I would expect it to be absent. They might have had local solutions or relied on natural resources but not a structured, specialized system as others might have.
</think>

The Republic of Venice III, existing between 1204 CE and 1563 CE, did not have a dedicated Drinking Water Supply System. While they utilized rivers for trade and navigation, there is no evidence of a specialized building or system solely designed to provide drinking water to the entire polity. Therefore, the answer is:

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama period had a Drinking Water Supply System as defined by the presence or absence of specialized buildings for drinking water. The time frame is between 1568 CE and 1603 CE.

First, I should understand what the Azuchi-Momoyama period is. From what I remember, this was a time when Japan transitioned from being part of the daimyō system to forming its own independent polity under the shogunate. It's often referred to as the "" Golden Period"" because of its cultural and economic prosperity.

During this time, there were significant changes in social structures, governance, and infrastructure. The Azuchi-Momoyama period started around 1568 with Oda Nobunaga's victory over the Tokugawa shogunate and continued through the early 17th century when it was succeeded by the Tokugawa shogunate.

Now, about drinking water supply systems. I know that in many historical contexts, especially during periods of urbanization or significant social change, the availability of clean water became a concern. In Japan, access to clean water has been an issue throughout history due to the presence of swamps and inefficient drainage systems.

During the Azuchi-Momoyama period, there were developments in infrastructure, including roads and trade routes, which might have facilitated better transportation of goods. However, I'm not sure if they had proper drinking water systems then. The Edo period that followed had ongoing water supply issues due to the decline of-ranked daimyō and increased urbanization leading to污水.

Wait, but the Azuchi-Momoyama was before Edo, so it's a different time. Maybe during this period, local governance started taking more power, which could have led to better infrastructure for drinking water as communities became more independent. The samurai class, which held significant political and military power, might have had an impact on the development of infrastructure.

I also remember that in some regions like Kyoto, there were efforts to improve water supply during this period with projects such as the Hozu River Embankment. These kinds of projects would involve both the local community and perhaps some state involvement if it was a centralized authority yet.

But I'm not sure if the term ""Drinking Water Supply System"" includes whether the state or community owned it. The definition says ""polity owned (which includes owned by the community, or the state)"". So if either the state or the community had control over water supply systems during this time, then it would be present.

Given that the Azuchi-Momoyama period was a time of significant reorganization and centralized governance under daimyō, I think there might have been some local systems established to manage resources. However, since they were part of a larger state system, it's possible that the water supply was managed by the central authority or local governing bodies.

Wait, but Oda Nobunaga is known for his military campaigns rather than infrastructure development. The period saw the establishment of the daimyō system with their own domains and armies, which might have included administrative structures for managing resources like water. So perhaps there were specialized buildings for drinking water because local governance was more structured.

However, I'm not entirely certain if these systems were as advanced or as consistently present as in later periods. It's possible that while there were some efforts to improve water supply, they weren't widespread or consistently present across the entire polity.

Another angle is to consider the role of rice cultivation and trade. If communities relied heavily on local water sources, then having a reliable water supply would have been crucial. This might have led to more investment in building infrastructure for water supply systems during this period.

But overall, I'm leaning towards believing that such a system was present because the polity had started to take shape with structured governance, which likely included managing resources necessary for daily life, including drinking water.
</think>

The polity of Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568–1603 CE) saw the emergence of a more structured society with centralized governance. This shift likely included the development of specialized buildings and systems to manage essential resources like drinking water. While there may not have been as advanced infrastructure as in later periods, the transition from a daimyō-based system to an independent polity under the shogunate probably necessitated some level of organization for resource management. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present during this time.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Tokugawa Shogunate had a Drinking Water Supply System in place. First, let me recall what the Tokugawa Shogunate was like historically. It was Japan's imperial family from 1603 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, right? They were responsible for maintaining control over Japan through military coups and established a centralized system of government.

Now, the question is about whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System during their rule. I know that many early modern polities needed access to clean water for both administrative purposes and daily life, especially in urban centers where people would live. So, having a reliable water supply system would have been essential for public health and governance.

I should consider the time period—1603 to 1868 CE. This covers from the early Edo Period through the late Edo and the beginning of Meiji. During this time, Japan was under the control of the Tokugawa shogunate, which had a system where they maintained control over all aspects of governance.

I remember that in many civilizations and historical periods, especially those with significant urbanization, having a centralized water supply system was common. For example, empires often built extensive systems to ensure a steady water supply for their capitals. The Tokugawa shogunate would have needed such a system to support their administrative offices located in cities like Tokyo.

Also, the shogunate had a strong control over resources and infrastructure. They would likely invest in infrastructure projects that benefit the entire polity, including drinking water. Additionally, as emperors and daimyōs relied on their subjects for labor and supplies, having reliable access to clean water could help maintain social order and support military operations.

However, I'm not entirely sure about specific details regarding Japan's water supply during this period. It might have been influenced by natural factors, like relying on rivers or seasonal rains, which are common in East Asia. But even with such resources, a more specialized system would still be beneficial for urban areas where clean water was needed year-round.

So, considering the administrative needs, centralization of power, and the importance of maintaining health during such a long period, it seems plausible that the Tokugawa Shogunate had a Drinking Water Supply System in place. They probably ensured access to clean water through specialized buildings and infrastructure.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Kara-Khanid polity had a drinking water supply system. First, I should recall what the Kara-Khanids were like historically.

From what I remember, the Kara-Khanids were a Mongol-Turkish principality that existed from around 950 CE until its conquest by Saladin in 1212 CE. They were known for their extensive trade networks and perhaps some advanced infrastructure given the time period. But I'm not sure about their water supply systems.

I think in medieval times, many polities relied on natural resources for drinking water. The Kara-Khanids probably had access to rivers or lakes, which would have provided them with water. If they did, then a specialized building system might not have been necessary because the water could be sourced locally without complex distribution networks.

However, if they were dealing with large territories, managing water efficiently could become more complicated. Maybe they had some infrastructure in place, but it's possible that a dedicated supply system wasn't as prominent unless they needed to regulate or transport large amounts of water for public use or agriculture.

Also, considering their role in trade and possibly religious needs, maybe they had access to local sources without needing elaborate systems. I'm not certain if they built specialized buildings for water supply because the information isn't something I recall specifically about them.

So putting it all together, while they might have needed some form of water management, there's no clear indication that a specialized drinking water supply system was present during their time.

The Kara-Khanid polity, active between 950 and 1212 CE, likely did not have a dedicated drinking water supply system. Their reliance on natural resources such as rivers suggests they managed water without the need for complex infrastructure. Thus, the presence of such a system is absent.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the Classical Angkor had a Drinking Water Supply System. First, I need to understand what the system entails. It's about specialized buildings that either the polity owns or where communities might use, providing water. So, this could include palaces, temples, granaries, etc., each of which might have its own water sources.

Classical Angkor was a massive empire in Cambodia, peaking around 12th to 13th century CE. The empire was known for its impressive architecture and extensive network of cities connected by roads. I remember that the Khmer Empire built an elaborate network with rivers and canals. They had granaries where rice was stored, which would require a water supply.

Palaces like Angkor Welles were huge structures. It makes sense they'd need reliable water for rituals, irrigation for nearby fields, and maybe even for drinking. Temples are also likely to have their own water systems since they needed clean water for sacred purposes.

I'm not sure about the specifics of whether each specialized building had its own system or if there was a centralized supply. Maybe the empire used a combination of local wells, rivers, and perhaps reservoirs built by skilled Khmer engineers. The central administration would have controlled this network to regulate water flow during dry seasons when water from rivers might be scarce.

Also, considering the size of the empire and its complex administrative structure, it's plausible that they had systems in place for every major building. This would ensure a steady supply across vast territories. Water management was crucial given their large population and expanding empire.

I don't recall any major historical sources indicating that the Angkore Empire didn't have such a system. Their architecture is so intricately tied to water, especially with rivers flowing through the landscape, it's likely they utilized specialized structures for water supply.

So, putting this all together, I think the Drinking Water Supply System would be present in Classical Angkor.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the Early Angkor polity had a Drinking Water Supply System. The time frame is from 802 CE to 1100 CE. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what I know about Angkor and its history.

First off, Angkor was a massive empire that existed in the Khmer region of Southeast Asia. It was one of the most powerful polities during its peak around the early 12th century. The Empire was known for its impressive architecture, including temples like Angkor Thom, which are still standing today. These structures were not only impressive architectural featues but also served various functions beyond just decoration.

Water supply systems in ancient empires often involved some form of infrastructure because having access to clean water is crucial for sustaining large populations and maintaining agricultural productivity. I remember that many civilizations invested heavily in irrigation systems, canals, reservoirs, and sometimes even water towers or wells to ensure a steady supply of water.

Angkor's history shows some advanced engineering. For instance, the construction of dams like Angkor Wat itself required a sophisticated system of water management. Additionally, the empire was known for its urban planning—some cities were planned meticulously with roads, drainage systems, and other infrastructure elements that suggest they considered resource management seriously.

However, I also recall that Angkor's political structure was quite complex but sometimes fragmented. After the peak period around 1200s, the empire fell into decline due to various factors like invasions, economic downturns, and internal strife. But during its peak, from about 802 CE up until maybe 1150s or so, it was a unified polity.

Now, thinking about whether they had a drinking water supply system: given the scale of Angkor's cities—some of them were as big as Siem Reap—with populations in the tens of thousands. A centralized water supply would have been essential to manage such large numbers effectively. They probably had systems like reservoirs, canals, and maybe even aqueducts.

But wait, I'm not sure if they had a formalized drinking water supply system specifically. Some sources mention that Angkor's cities were well-engineered with extensive drainage systems and that they might have used natural springs or river systems for drinking water, relying on seasonal rains as well. However, ensuring a continuous supply without contamination would be a challenge.

Another angle is to look at other regions in Southeast Asia during the same period. For example, in Thailand before its independence, there were water rationing systems due to dams and reservoirs being used for hydroelectric power. But that's more recent than Angkor's time. The Khmer Empire might have had similar or even better systems.

Also, considering that the empire was so vast, having a separate building or structure dedicated solely to drinking water seems unlikely because their resources were probably distributed across the empire's needs rather than centralized at one place. But then again, maybe they did have specialized buildings for storing and distributing water in cities.

I'm also thinking about whether there are any historical records or inscriptions mentioning the presence of such a system. The Khmer Empire is rich with stone carvings that depict infrastructure like bridges, roads, temples, and engineering marvels but I don't recall seeing anything specific about elaborate drinking water systems from their inscriptions.

On the other hand, during the height of Angkor's power, they might have had the capacity to manage a more centralized system due to their extensive administration. But by 1200s, when the empire started declining, perhaps they faced challenges in maintaining such systems because of population growth or resource issues.

So putting it all together: while there are no explicit records about a dedicated drinking water supply system for Angkor's polity, the engineering capabilities and the scale of their cities suggest that having some form of water management was present. They might have relied more on natural resources like rivers and seasonal rains rather than a centralized system with specialized buildings.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question defines a Drinking Water Supply System as including specialized buildings owned by the polity or community. So if they didn't have such buildings but had other infrastructure (like canals or reservoirs), would that count? Or does the system need to be present through specialized buildings?

If only infrastructure like canals and reservoirs existed without specialized buildings dedicated to it, maybe it's considered absent in terms of the variable as defined. But if they did have systems that provided clean water, even if not through a single specialized building but through a network of structures, then perhaps it's present.

Alternatively, considering the decline phase after 1200s, they might have had issues maintaining such systems, which could imply absence during certain periods. However, since the question is about the polity as a whole between 802 and 1100 CE, I should consider whether it was present at some point.

Given all this, I'm leaning towards 'present' because their engineering capabilities suggest they had systems to manage water resources, even if not through a single specialized building. They might have used multiple structures for water storage and distribution across cities.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Monte Alban III between 200 CE and 500 CE. First, I should understand what Monte Alban was. From my limited knowledge, Monte Alban seems to refer to a city or polity, possibly an ancient Mediterranean settlement. The time frame given is from the early Roman Empire period up until the late antiquity.

Now, considering the definition of Drinking Water Supply System provided: it's about whether there were specialized buildings that supply drinking water, either owned by the polity, its community, or the state. If absent, it means no such system existed; if present, then yes.

I know that many ancient cities and polities had some form of water supply systems, especially as urbanization increased. For example, places like Alexandria in Egypt had a well system that was crucial for their population. Similarly, Roman cities were often equipped with aqueducts and wells to provide clean drinking water. Monte Alban, being a polity, might have followed suit.

However, the time frame is 200-500 CE. The Roman Empire was expanding but also facing internal issues around this period. There's the Aldo-Monteverde Period (370–410 CE) where there was instability, and then theomanic phase from about 410 to 508 CE due to invasions like the Huns and Visigoths. So during these times, the polity might have faced challenges that could affect infrastructure.

But I also recall that some cities managed to maintain their systems despite such disruptions. For instance, Thessalonica had a well system in place even underoman rule. Similarly, places like Cañada (which is modern Cusco, Peru) had water systems that were important for governance and daily life.

Moreover, the presence of specialized buildings for water supply would suggest some level of organization or investment into infrastructure. Even if there were challenges, the polity might have repaired or maintained their water systems to keep functioning.

Additionally, considering the era around 200-500 CE, which is a period of mixed empires and regional conflicts, it's possible that Monte Alban was part of a larger network where such systems existed. Even if other parts were struggling, the polity itself might have been able to maintain its infrastructure due to local efforts or resourcefulness.

Therefore, putting this together, I think it's reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present in Monte Alban III during this period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Late Angkor polity, which existed from 1220 CE to 1432 CE, had a Drinking Water Supply System. The system in question is defined as specialized buildings owned by the polity or its community that provide drinking water.

First, I should recall what I know about the Angkorian Empire during this period. Angkor was one of the largest and most complex civilizations in Southeast Asia, known for its impressive architecture, especially at the site of Siem Reap where Angkor Wat is located. The empire was known for its centralized authority, monumental architecture, and extensive administrative systems.

Considering the time frame from 1220 to 1432 CE, this period includes both the high point of the empire under King Suryavarman II (ruling until his death in 1265) and later periods where there were fluctuations due to conflicts or internal governance issues. After Suryavarman II's death, the empire faced challenges such as wars, succession issues, and maybe even decline.

Angkor was one of the few civilizations that managed to maintain a centralized system throughout its history, which would suggest that they had well-organized infrastructure. For a polity like Angkor to function effectively, especially in terms of daily life, having access to clean water would be essential for both administration and religious sites like temples.

The term ""drinking water supply system"" implies not just the availability of water but also how it's distributed through specialized buildings—like reservoirs, water treatment facilities, or distribution systems. I remember that many Angkorian sites had extensive water systems integrated into their architecture and infrastructure. For instance, Siem Reap alone has a network of basins and channels that supply water to the city and surrounding temples.

Moreover, considering the social scale of Angkor, which had a large population, having an organized water system would help manage resources efficiently. The empire's administrative capacity suggests they could handle such systems, especially since many of their architectural marvels were built with precise engineering, including intricate water channels for irrigation or drinking purposes.

However, I should also consider if there were any periods where Angkor experienced significant disruptions that might have affected their water supply system. For example, during wars or times of political instability, the maintenance of such systems could have been compromised. But given the time frame up until 1432 CE, which is before the decline phases, it's possible that while challenges existed, they didn't necessarily eliminate the need for a water supply system.

Additionally, I recall that many Angkorian temples and administrative centers were built with elaborate water systems integrated into their design. This would suggest a deliberate effort to ensure a reliable water supply for both residential and sacred sites.

In conclusion, considering the scale of the empire, the centralization required for administration, and the engineering expertise present in their architecture, it's reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present during the Late Angkor period. They likely maintained such systems through specialized buildings and infrastructure to meet the water needs of their population and temples.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Khmer Kingdom had a Drinking Water Supply System in place during its time, which was between 1432 CE and 1594 CE. The user has defined this system as either present or absent based on specialized buildings owned by the polity (which could include both public and community ownership). 

First, I should recall what I know about the Khmer Kingdom. It's one of the most well-known ancient civilizations in Southeast Asia, known for its grand architecture, especially at Angkor. The empire was quite extensive, covering a large area from Cambodia to present-day Thailand.

From my basic understanding, many ancient civilizations invested heavily in infrastructure because water was essential for daily life—clean drinking water, especially in urban areas where sanitation wasn't as advanced. They built reservoirs, canals, and elaborate systems to supply water efficiently.

The Khmer Empire had several centers of power, like Angkor Thom, which are massive fortifications surrounded by palaces and temples. These structures likely required a reliable water supply system to sustain the populations living in them. Given that these places were part of the state's infrastructure, it seems plausible that such systems would exist.

Additionally, Khmer stone carvings often depict people using water for religious rituals, domestic tasks, and irrigation—indicative of the importance placed on water. The empire was known for its engineering prowess; they built dams to create reservoirs, which would provide a steady supply of water during dry seasons or urban planning needs.

However, considering their geographical location in what is now Southeast Asia, many parts of the empire were vulnerable to flooding from monsoons and rivers. This could complicate water management systems. But even so, having some form of water supply system would have been necessary for administrative efficiency and population sustainability.

Also, there's evidence that the Khmer Empire had a centralized government which would manage such resources efficiently. They might have had both state-owned infrastructure and, possibly, communal usage as well.

I should also think about any archaeological findings related to water systems during their reign. Angkor Wat, for example, is surrounded by a massive moat, suggesting that water was used in their defense but not necessarily as an integrated supply system. However, the surrounding towns might have had their own infrastructure, which could contribute to understanding whether a centralized system existed.

In summary, given the importance of water in daily life and the engineering capabilities demonstrated by the Khmer Empire, it's reasonable to expect that they would have implemented some form of Drinking Water Supply System within their polity.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Chenla between 550 CE and 825 CE. First, I should probably recall what Chenla was. From history, I remember that Chenla is an ancient Chinese city located in modern-day Shaanxi province. It was quite significant during the Tang Dynasty, which ruled from 618 to 907 CE. Since our time frame is between 550 and 825, that's within the Tang Dynasty.

Now, thinking about water supply systems, I know that many ancient city-states had sophisticated infrastructure for their populations. The Tang Dynasty was known for its advancements in various fields, including engineering and urban planning. Cities like长安 (Beijing) during this period had extensive networks of canals and reservoirs to manage water supplies efficiently.

Chenla being part of the Tang Dynasty would likely have had such a system. The Tang government probably owned or controlled these systems to ensure reliable water supply for both residents and agriculture, which was crucial for their economy. Specialized buildings like reservoirs, treatment plants, and distribution networks were common in well-planned cities.

Also, considering the time period, 825 CE is just before the decline of the Tang Dynasty under Liardate's rule, but even then, infrastructure wasn't always abandoned immediately. It's plausible that Chenla continued to have a water supply system up until at least 825.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Funan I between 225 CE and 540 CE. First, let's break down what the question is asking. A Drinking Water Supply System (DWS) here refers to specialized buildings owned by a polity for providing water, which could be their own structures or built by the community. The task is to determine if such a system was present or absent in Funan I during that period.

I remember that Funan I was a polity located in what is now Henan province, China. It was one of several early state-level polities that emerged in East Asia around the 1st-3rd centuries CE. These polities were significant because they established centralized governance and began developing infrastructure like roads, irrigation systems, and possibly water supply.

I think Funan I's history includes periods where they built infrastructure to support their growing population. For example, the Great Wall of China is often attributed toFunan I as one of its early contributors. Building infrastructure would require not just materials but also systems for delivering resources efficiently. Drinking water would be essential for both daily life and military operations.

During that time, Funan I was expanding its influence through military campaigns. They needed reliable sources of water not only for their own use but also to support their conquests. The Yellow River is a major water source in that region, so it's plausible they had systems in place to manage it.

I recall that during the Tang Dynasty (which Funan I was part of), there were advancements in public works and infrastructure. They might have implemented projects like reservoirs or filtration systems to ensure a steady supply of potable water. These systems would have been necessary as their empire grew, especially with the expansion southward into what is now Anhui province.

However, not all polities at this time had such systems. Some might have relied more on local resources or natural sources without formalized infrastructure. But given that Funan I was a centralized state, it's likely they had some form of organized water supply system to manage their resources effectively.

Also, considering the historical context, around 200 BCE, Funan I began expanding its influence and integrating with other states in what is now Shandong province. Managing resources during such expansion would require efficient systems for water distribution, possibly including specialized buildings like treatment facilities or reservoirs owned by the state.

Therefore, putting this all together, it seems reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present in Funan I during their polity period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Funan II between 540 CE and 640 CE. I know that Funan II is the polity of Japan from 589 to 913 CE, but here it's specified as existing from 540 to 640 CE. Wait, maybe there was a shorter period? Or perhaps it's referring to a different interval within their history.

First, I should clarify what Funan II refers to. It might be the early period of the Nara Period since Funan is one of the three main palaces (Heisei, Hōgei, Funan) that were important in Japan during the Nara era. The Nara Period started around 589 CE when Emperor Toyotomi Hideyoshi moved the capital to Nara. However, if this period starts at 540 CE, maybe it's referring to an earlier time, perhaps before the Heisei became prominent.

Now, regarding the Drinking Water Supply System (DWS), I know that Japan had various systems for providing water, especially during times of conflict or change. The Edo Period (1603-1867) saw significant changes with the introduction of Western influences and foreign capital, but Funan II is much earlier.

During the Nara Period, the government did implement infrastructure projects to improve living conditions. There was an emphasis on public utilities like roads and drainage systems. However, I'm not sure about specific water supply systems at that time.

I recall that during the Heisei period (the early Nara), there were significant changes with foreign investment and governance. The introduction of Western-style city planning might have included infrastructure improvements, including water supplies. However, Funan II specifically refers to a polity between 540 and 640 CE, which would include parts of the Nara Period but also possibly earlier times.

If Funan II is before the Heisei period, say around 589 CE when Nara became prominent, then maybe water supply systems were being developed. However, if it's referring to a time when Japan was under nominal rule by Korea or the North China Dynasties (such as the Sui and Liang朝), there might not have been a polity-wide system because they often relied on local sources or had fragmented governance.

Wait, Funan II likely refers to an area that became the Nara Period's administrative center. So from 540 to 640 CE would be a time when Japan was transitioning from being under foreign rule (Omo and Liang dynasties) to its own independent period. During this transition, they might have been setting up systems like water supply as part of their rebuilding efforts.

Alternatively, if Funan II is referring to the early Heisei period, around 589-632 CE, then it's plausible that they had started implementing infrastructure including water supplies as part of urban development. However, I'm not entirely certain about specific records from that time.

Given all this, I think there might have been a drinking water supply system during Funan II, especially if the polity was beginning to establish more centralized governance and infrastructure projects. So my tentative answer would be 'present', but I'm not 100% sure.

The Drinking Water Supply System present in Funan II is expected to be:

Alright, so I need to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System in the Archaic Basin of Mexico between 6000 BCE and 2001 BCE. Hmm, okay. Let me start by breaking down what the question is asking.

First, the term ""Drinking Water Supply System"" refers to specialized buildings or infrastructure that provide access to safe drinking water. This could include things like wells, pipes, reservoirs, or even entire communities having access to clean water through specific structures.

Now, the Archaic Basin of Mexico—I'm assuming this is a region in pre-Columbian Mexico, maybe including places like the Yucatanpen, Cholula, or Puebla areas. This period spans about 6000 years, from around the time of the early Ancestral Puebloans to the Aztec Empire's fall.

Thinking about early human settlements, basic infrastructure would have been essential for survival and daily life. Without reliable water sources, communities might struggle to sustain themselves, especially in arid or mountainous regions where water is scarce. So, it makes sense that early polities would develop some system to manage their water resources.

I remember reading that many ancient civilizations, including the Aztecs and Maya, had sophisticated systems for water supply. For example, the Maya built reservoirs and channels to bring water from distant sources. The Aztecs also had extensive irrigation systems for agriculture. If these advanced civilizations had such systems, it's plausible that smaller or regional polities in the Archaic Basin would too.

However, I should consider if there are any examples of absence. Maybe some isolated villages or small groups didn't need a complex system because they were self-sufficient or located in areas where water was abundant and easily accessible. But given that it's a basin covering multiple regions with varied topography, it's more likely that the earliest polities would have systems to manage water across their territories.

Also, the presence of trade routes and agriculture often necessitated good infrastructure, including water supplies. For example, the Guadalete Aqueduct in Mexico City is one of the oldest known, dating back over 2000 years. If that's part of the region being considered, it suggests a long-standing system.

On the other hand, if the basin was largely rural or sparsely populated at the time, maybe early systems weren't as developed. But given the time frame and the nature of such regions, I think there would be some level of water management in place.

So, putting this all together, it's reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System would have been present. There's historical evidence of advanced water systems in similar areas, even if they were smaller or less elaborate than later examples.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity in the Early Formative Basin of Mexico would have had a Drinking Water Supply System. The time frame is from 1200 BCE to 801 BCE.

First, I should understand what this region was like during that period. The Early Formative Basin refers to areas around present-day Mexico and Central America. This was the formative period for civilizations in these regions, so it's before the formation of major city-states or empires.

During this time, water was crucial because much of the land is arid or mountainous, making reliable water sources essential. Without a good water supply system, people would struggle to survive, especially during dry seasons.

I know that many early civilizations developed some form of water management. For example, the Aztecs and Maya had sophisticated systems. The Aztecs built reservoirs and canals for their cities, which suggests they had a planned way to manage water. Similarly, the Maya in Central America likely had systems to ensure access to water through their agriculture.

However, I also need to consider that this is an early polity. Maybe it's just the beginning stages where communities are forming, so they might not have established such complex systems yet. They could be relying on local sources like rivers or wells without formal infrastructure.

Another point is the governance aspect. If the polity was under the control of a centralized authority, they would likely invest in infrastructure to manage resources effectively. But if it was more decentralized, maybe with multiple local leaders, water supply might not have been as systematically planned.

I should also think about specific examples within this time frame. For instance, the Chontal people around 1200 BCE were using wells and natural springs, which indicates some form of water management without a formal supply system. As these communities grew, they probably needed more efficient systems to sustain larger populations.

In conclusion, while it's possible that an early polity in this region might not have had a full-fledged Drinking Water Supply System right away, by the end of the 8th century BCE, as their infrastructure developed and city-states began to form, such systems would likely emerge. So expecting presence makes sense.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether an Inca Empire would have a Drinking Water Supply System. The question defines this system as specialized buildings that the polity owns or uses for water supply—either owned by the community or the state.

First, I should recall what the Inca Empire was like. It existed from around 1375 CE to 1532 CE under Atahualpa and his descendants. The empire was known for its vast infrastructure: roads, cities, agriculture, engineering works like dams and canals. They had a decentralized governance system with quipus for record-keeping.

Water supply would have been crucial given the high altitudes of their Andean capital, Cuzco. If I think about other ancient civilizations, many had sophisticated water systems. For example, the Egyptians built the Pyramids which required careful water management, and the Greeks had well systems. The Indus Valley civilization is known for its advanced drainage systems.

The Incas were highly centralized. They had a fixed system of roads leading to all their cities, which suggests they needed reliable water sources. Without proper infrastructure, how would they supply the population with water across such vast territories?

Also, the Inca built an extensive network of reservoirs and canals. The famous Salkantay River is part of this system, indicating a deliberate effort to manage water flow effectively.

Considering their engineering prowess, they likely developed methods to store and distribute water efficiently. They might have had specialized buildings or infrastructure like reservoirs, which are examples of specialized systems for water supply.

Moreover, the empire's administrative complexity would necessitate organized water management to ensure every region received adequate supplies without waste.

So putting this all together, it seems logical that an Inca polity would have a Drinking Water Supply System due to their advanced engineering and organizational structures.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Wari Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System based on my knowledge of their history. Let's start by recalling what I know about the Wari Empire.

The Wari Empire was an Andean empire that existed from approximately 650 CE to 999 CE. It was known for its vast cities like Chavín de Huántar and Lima, which were some of the largest urban centers at the time. The empire was heavily centralized, with a well-defined administrative structure.

Water supply systems in ancient empires vary widely. Many had sophisticated irrigation systems, especially in regions where water was scarce. For example, the Indus Valley Civilization had advanced drainage systems, and other empires like the Aztec or Mayan also had complex water management systems.

The Wari Empire's cities were massive, which would necessitate a reliable water supply system to support the growing populations and infrastructure. They might have needed systems for both irrigation and urbanization purposes. However, I'm not sure if they specifically implemented centralized drinking water systems like the ones we see in many modern city-states or empires.

I remember that Chavín de Huántar was a major city, and there are mentions of water being used in various contexts—maybe for cooking, cleaning, or urban hygiene. But does this translate to a dedicated system? The Wari Empire's political structure was highly centralized, so it's possible they had some form of water management.

On the other hand, maybe their focus was more on agriculture and trade rather than domestic water supply. They were known for their terraced farming in the Andes, which would require careful water management to prevent flooding or droughts. This might have been sufficient for agricultural use but perhaps not as specialized for urban drinking.

Also, considering their size and administration, maintaining a centralized system could have been resource-intensive. If they prioritized other aspects like roads, trade, or defense, maybe water supply didn't take precedence in the same way.

I'm also thinking about whether neighboring civilizations had similar systems that influenced the Wari Empire. For instance, if the Maya or Aztecs had advanced water systems, it's possible the Wari might have adapted theirs to some extent. But without direct evidence from the Wari's texts or records about their water supply, this is speculative.

Moreover, the decline of the Wari Empire around 1000 CE could be due to various factors, including environmental issues like droughts if they relied too heavily on water. This might suggest that while a system existed initially, it wasn't sustained or expanded in later centuries, indicating absence over time.

In summary, I'm leaning towards ""absent"" because the information isn't explicitly stated about them having such a system, and their emphasis was more on agriculture and possibly less on domestic water supply. However, without concrete evidence, this is uncertain.
</think>

The Wari Empire's history suggests that while they may have utilized water for various purposes, including agricultural and urban contexts, there is no explicit record of a centralized Drinking Water Supply System as defined in the question. Given their emphasis on agriculture and trade rather than domestic water supply systems, it is reasonable to conclude that such a system was absent.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System (DWSS) existed in the polity ""Orokaiva - Colonial"" between 1884 CE and 1942 CE. The question defines DWSS as either present or absent based on specialized buildings owned by the polity or its community, which includes both state and community ownership.

First, I should recall what Orokaiva - Colonial refers to. From my limited knowledge, Orokaiva is a historical site in Brazil, specifically in the Amazon region near the city of Boa Vista. It's known for its indigenous populations and its colonial period under Portuguese rule. The ""Orokaiva - Colonial"" polity might refer to this historical context or perhaps a fictional or hypothetical polity based on it.

Assuming Orokaiva refers to the area around Boa Vista, which was part of Brazil during the 16th century under Portuguese rule but later became independent in the early 20th century. However, the time frame given is from 1884 to 1942 CE, so that's after Orokaiva was ceded by Portugal to Brazil in 1822 and became an independent state in 1969. Wait, no, actually, Brazil declared its independence from Portugal on August 15, 1822, but the period I'm considering here is up to 1942, which was before Brazil's independence.

Wait, that can't be right because Brazil became independent in 1822. So perhaps Orokaiva - Colonial refers to a fictional polity based on Brazil during its colonial period under Portuguese rule from the late 15th century to early 19th century or so. But the timeframe given is 1884-1942, which falls after the end of Portuguese rule in Brazil.

Alternatively, Orokaiva might refer to a specific area within Brazil's Amazon region that was under colonial control by either Portuguese, Spanish, or Dutch colonizers. The time frame suggests we're looking at post-colonial Brazilian history, perhaps focusing on indigenous movements and colonial administration.

If Orokaiva is an area that was under colonial rule, then between 1884 and 1942, it would have been part of the Brazilian Empire or under Portuguese or Spanish colonial administration. During this period, many colonial towns in Brazil had systems for providing drinking water to their populations. Towns often built specialized buildings with water towers, reservoirs, and distribution networks.

However, considering that Orokaiva is near Boa Vista, which was an important town in the Brazilian Amazon under Portuguese rule, it's likely that during the colonial period, such a polity would have had some form of DWSS. But wait, the time frame here is 1884-1942 CE, which is within the post-colonial period for Brazil but before its independence in 1822? No, that doesn't make sense because Brazil was independent by then.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. The Portuguese colony in Brazil ended when Brazil became independent on August 15, 1822. So the time frame of 1884-1942 would be within the post-Brazilian period but under the control of other colonial powers or during the early years after independence.

Alternatively, perhaps Orokaiva - Colonial refers to a specific polity that existed during this time, which might have been an independent state under colonial rule. If that's the case, then the DWSS would depend on how the colonizers set up water supply systems in such areas.

In many post-colonial regions, especially those with indigenous populations, the administration of drinking water was often tied to the colonial power or the newly established nation. Towns sometimes built their own infrastructure to provide water, which could include wells, reservoirs, or even decentralized systems where local leaders were responsible for water supply.

Moreover, considering that this polity existed between 1884 and 1942, it's possible that during its existence, they had established a DWSS as part of their governance structure. The presence of such systems was common in many colonial towns to ensure basic needs like drinking water were met for the population.

However, there are exceptions where indigenous communities might have managed water resources differently or without centralized systems. But given that it's a polity with its own governance, it's reasonable to expect that they would have had some form of DWSS, even if it was decentralized or community-owned.

Therefore, I think that the Drinking Water Supply System would be present in Orokaiva - Colonial during this period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the polity known as Kachi Plain during its proto-historical period, which was from 1300 BCE to 500 BCE. The question defines this system as specialized buildings that are owned by the polity or the community, including the state if it's relevant.

First, I should recall what Kachi Plain is known for historically. From what I remember, KachiPlain refers to a region in present-day southwestern China, specifically in the Yunnan province. During the proto-historical period (1300-500 BCE), this area was part of various empires and kingdoms, including the Qin, Han, and later the Sui and Tang dynasties.

I know that during these early periods, many regions had to manage their water resources themselves because centralized systems were not yet established. So, local communities would likely have built their own infrastructure for water supply. For example, during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE), while they did consolidate power and might have had some centralization, their infrastructure was still quite localized.

Community ownership of water systems makes sense because with a decentralized society, each village or tribe would manage resources based on their needs. Specialized buildings like reservoirs, wells, filtration systems, and distribution networks would have been constructed to ensure access to clean drinking water. These structures were necessary for sustenance, especially as the population grew and more complex activities required potable water.

However, I should also consider the socio-economic status of the time. The proto-historical period was marked by significant changes in agriculture, trade, and possibly urbanization. As societies became more complex, the demand for reliable water supply would increase. Early empires often built impressive infrastructure, such as the Great Wall of China, which suggests a similar level of investment in other systems.

Moreover, water was a critical resource during this period because it was used for irrigation, cooking, and health. Managing it efficiently would help support larger populations and more complex governance structures. If the Kachi Plain polity had a well-defined government system by then, they might have integrated these water supply systems under their administration. Alternatively, since it's proto-historical, maybe the structure wasn't yet fully centralized.

Another angle is to look at historical sources or inscriptions from that period in the region of KachiPlain (Yunnan). If there are records indicating the construction or usage of such systems, that would support the presence. On the other hand, if there's evidence that they were using a different water management method without specialized buildings, it might suggest absence.

I should also consider the transition from the Qin to the Han and then later periods. During these times, empires often improved infrastructure, including water supply systems, but whether KachiPlain specifically adopted centralized systems would depend on its political structure at the time.

In summary, given the period and context, it's plausible that a Drinking Water Supply System was present in Kachi Plain during its proto-historical period. The need for such systems grew with population increases and more intensive agricultural practices, and even early empires like the Qin had centralized systems.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Kachi Plain - Urban Period I, which was between 2500 BCE and 2100 BCE. I don't know much about this specific period or polity, but I can try to think through what I know about ancient civilizations and their infrastructure.

First, I remember that many ancient societies developed some form of water supply systems because water is crucial for drinking, agriculture, and transportation. For example, cities like Mesopotamia in the region of modern-day Iraq had elaborate irrigation systems for their agriculture. Similarly, Egypt built elaborate networks to manage their vast Nile River resources.

Now, considering the Kachi Plain, I recall that it's an arid region. In such places, water is a precious resource, so having a reliable supply system would have been essential. Even if the polity in question was urbanized and settled around this area, it might need to invest in infrastructure like wells, channels, or reservoirs to ensure access to water.

I'm not sure about the exact time period of the Kachi Plain's history, but 2500 BCE is quite early. If the region had settled intoUrban Period I, they would likely have needed basic services, including water supply. Specialized buildings for such systems suggest that it was a deliberate design rather than just a temporary need.

However, without specific information about their political structure or engineering capabilities during that time, it's hard to be certain. But given the arid nature of the Kachi Plain and the importance of water in early human settlements, it seems plausible that they would have had some form of Drinking Water Supply System.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed during the Kachi Plain - Urban Period II, which was from 2100 BCE to 1800 BCE. I'm not very familiar with this specific polity, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I should understand what a Drinking Water Supply System entails. From the definition given, it's a specialized building owned by the polity, which could be either the state or the community. So if there were such buildings for providing water, that would mean the system is present; otherwise, it's absent.

I know that many ancient civilizations developed systems to manage their water resources because water was essential for agriculture, drinking, andIndustry. For example, places like Mesopotamia had sophisticated irrigation systems. But I'm not sure about the Kachi Plain specifically.

The time period in question is from 2100 BCE to 1800 BCE, which is a significant span that includes several civilizations. The Kachi Plain was part of what we now know as South America, near present-day Peru and Bolivia. During this time, there were various cultures like the Chavín de Huántar culture, which flourished around 1250–600 BCE. They had complex city-states with systems for water storage and distribution.

Also, the Andean region has evidence of water management systems using terraced farming (irrigation) to support agriculture in high altitudes where rainfall is minimal. The presence of such systems suggests that water supply was a deliberate effort by the polity to ensure sustainability.

Given this, it's plausible that during the Kachi Plain - Urban Period II, there were specialized buildings or infrastructure designed for water supply. These might include reservoirs, distribution networks, and possibly treatment facilities to make water safe for drinking.

However, I'm not certain if these systems existed specifically in every city of the region or only in major centers. The question refers to 'the polity,' so it's possible that as a whole, they had such systems rather than individual cities within the polity.

Additionally, historical records from this period might mention architectural features indicative of water management, like elevated tanks or pipes for distribution. Without specific evidence, I can only speculate based on similar civilizations known to have such systems.

In conclusion, considering the need for reliable water sources and the complexity of managing water in arid regions, it's reasonable to expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present during this period.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a polity called Sakha - Early had a Drinking Water Supply System. The time frame is between 1400 CE and 1632 CE. 

First, I need to understand what a Drinking Water Supply System entails. It's defined as specialized buildings owned by the polity, either through ownership or the state, for providing drinking water. So, if the polity had such a system, it would be present; otherwise, it would be absent.

Now, Sakha - Early is an early modern polity in the midders region of Siberia. I don't have specific information about their history beyond that, but I can think about general trends in historical societies regarding water supply systems.

In many pre-modern societies, especially those with settled populations or large communities, access to clean drinking water was essential for health and daily life. Settled communities likely developed infrastructure like wells, tubewells, or filtration systems to provide safe water. However, these systems were often community-owned rather than state-owned because the governance might have been decentralized.

Considering that Sakha - Early is situated in a region prone to harsh weather conditions—siberia—it's possible they would have faced challenges with obtaining clean water from natural sources like rivers or rainwater. This could drive the need for reliable water supply systems, which might be provided by local communities.

I recall that in many ancient and medieval polities, especially those in colder climates, the construction of such infrastructure was common due to the scarcity of resources. They would have needed a system to ensure access to clean drinking water to maintain their populations, conduct agriculture, trade, etc.

However, I'm not sure if Sakha - Early specifically had a written system or if it was more decentralized and perhaps community-based. Also, considering the time frame up to 1632 CE, which is before the arrival of Russian tsars but during other Mongol and other invasions, their governance might have been dynamic.

Given that Sakha - Early existed between 1400-1632, it's plausible they would have developed or relied on a system to manage water supply. They might not have had a state-level system in place yet if their administration was more tribal or decentralized. But even so, having at least some specialized buildings for water supply is likely.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards the presence of such a system based on the need and the likelihood that community efforts would provide it.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity called Sakha - Late, which existed from 1632 CE to 1900 CE, would have had a Drinking Water Supply System. I'm not exactly familiar with this polity, but I'll try to break it down.

First, the time frame is between the late 17th century and early 19th century. That's during a lot of historical changes—colonialism, exploration, maybe some internal conflicts or expansions depending on where Sakha - Late is located. But since I don't have specific geographical info, I'll assume it's in an area that was part of European colonization at the time.

Drinking water supply systems can come from various sources: wells, rivers, pumps, tanks, or sometimes even community-built solutions like cisterns or filtered tap water. In some contexts, especially in settled areas with infrastructure development, these systems are more likely to exist.

If Sakha - Late was part of a colonial administration by European powers, it's plausible that they would have established drinking water systems as part of their urban planning and resource management. They might have built reservoirs or wells to ensure access to clean water for the colonized population. However, there are also challenges like disease spread, pollution from waste, and maintenance issues with such systems.

Alternatively, if the polity was an independent state within a region that already had a reliable water supply source, maybe from a local river or natural spring, it might not be necessary to have its own system. But given the timeframe, which includes periods of exploration and possible conflict, they might have needed to secure their resources.

I should also consider if there are any historical examples within this time frame for similar polities. For instance, many European-settled territories did establish water systems post-colonialism, especially when dealing with health issues that arose from new settlers.

So putting it all together, I think a Drinking Water Supply System would likely be present, either through local construction or as part of the colonial administration efforts.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a polity called Rattanakosin had a Drinking Water Supply System between 1782 CE and 1873 CE. I'm not too familiar with Rattanakosin, but from what I remember, it's an ancient kingdom in Thailand. They were known for their advanced water management systems.

I think Rattanakosin was a significant polity around the early to mid-19th century, right? So within that time frame given (1782 to 1873), which covers from when Thailand was still under Mongol rule up until their decline and eventual merger with modern-day Thailand in 1905.

I recall that many ancient Thai kingdoms had sophisticated systems for managing water resources. They built dams, reservoirs, and canals to manage monsoon rains effectively. This would ensure a steady supply of clean drinking water, which is crucial, especially during dry seasons when rainfall isn't as frequent.

Moreover, Rattanakosin was known for its administrative efficiency, maintaining granaries and managing agricultural production, including rice cultivation. Efficient water management would have been essential to support their agriculture and overall society's needs.

Given that other Thai polities had such systems, it's likely that Rattanakosin also had a Drinking Water Supply System in place during this period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System (DWS) existed in the Byzantine Empire during its time, which was from 632 CE to 866 CE. The definition given says that DWS is present if there are special buildings owned by the polity or the community for water supply.

First, I should recall what the Byzantine Empire was like. It was a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire, so it was a vast and complex political entity. The empire covered a large area in both Europe and the Middle East, including places like Greece, Albania,adygeia (modern-day Georgia), and Anatolia.

Water supply systems would have been essential for maintaining settlements, especially in arid regions or areas prone to drought. The Byzantines likely had significant agricultural activities, so access to water would be crucial for farming communities. They might have used various methods of water extraction, such as wells, rivers, and maybe even ditches.

I remember that the Byzantine Empire was known for its administrative efficiency. They probably had systems in place to manage resources, including water. Maybe they built reservoirs or used natural sources like the Euphrates river, which flows through their territory. Also, considering their extensive trade networks, they might have relied on imported water from regions with more reliable sources.

But then again, during certain times, like when empires fall apart or are under siege, they might have struggled with maintaining such systems. However, the Byzantine Empire lasted until 866 CE, so it was a relatively stable period compared to other empires that fell earlier.

I also think about the role of monasteries and churches in providing water through their wells, especially in urban areas like Constantinople. Monasteries were often self-sufficient, with their own water systems, but I'm not sure if this applies to the entire polity or just individual monasteries.

Moreover, considering the Byzantine government's infrastructure, they likely had a centralized system where they owned and maintained the necessary buildings for water supply, such as reservoirs, treatment facilities, and distribution networks. These would be essential for maintaining public health and agricultural productivity across their empire.

However, I'm not entirely certain if all regions within the Byzantine Empire had access to such systems due to varying geographical conditions and resources. For example, areas that are more arid might have relied more on natural water sources without needing elaborate infrastructure, while fertile regions might have focused more on irrigation rather than relying solely on a supply system.

In summary, given their vast empire and the necessity for reliable water supply, especially in agricultural societies, it's plausible that the Byzantine Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System present. They were likely equipped with the necessary structures to manage this resource efficiently.
</think>

The answer is XXXpresentXXX.

The Byzantine Empire, existing from 632 CE to 866 CE, likely maintained a Drinking Water Supply System (DWS) due to its extensive territorial coverage and reliance on agriculture, which necessitated reliable water sources. The empire's organized administration would have included infrastructure such as reservoirs, wells, and distribution networks to ensure access to water in both urban and rural areas. Although there might be variations based on geographical conditions, the centralization of resources and governance suggests that a DWS was present during this period.",absent

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in the Byzantine Empire II between 867 CE and 1072 CE. The user provided a definition that includes specialized buildings owned by the polity or the community, which can include the state. So, if such buildings exist for providing drinking water, then it's present; otherwise, absent.

First, I should recall what the Byzantine Empire II period covers. It starts in 867 CE and ends in 1072 CE, so that includes parts of the medieval period with the late Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire was known for its extensive infrastructure because they inherited a lot from the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire, which had been established after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

During this time, the empire went through various phases: initially focusing on recovering territories and stabilizing their capital, Constantinople; then dealing with invasions, especially from the Avars in the 9th century; and later facing Viking incursions. After 1054, they moved their capital to Ravenna, which became a significant center.

Hygiene and access to clean water are important for health and living standards. The Byzantine Empire had systems like the hospitals of Constantinople that were well-known, but water supply might be more complex. I know that in many ancient city-states or empires, they often built reservoirs or used natural sources like rivers for drinking water.

The late Byzantine period (from 10th to 15th century) saw a decline in resources and population growth leading to urbanization. They might have had centralized systems, possibly involving the state, but given the time frame up to 1072 CE, which is before significant decline, it's possible that they still maintained such systems.

Also, considering their administrative structure, they had the Justinianic Code in the early 10th century, which was an organized legal code. This suggests a system of governance and infrastructure, including possibly water supply through laws and buildings.

I should check if there are any references or sources indicating that during this period, the Byzantine Empire had drinking water systems. For example, in cities like Constantinople, they built large aqueducts for drinking water. But if their focus shifted to other aspects after 1054, maybe the emphasis on water supply diminished.

Wait, though, I think even as empires decline, they often still maintained essential services due to community needs or state necessity. So it's possible that during this period from 867 to 1072 CE, the Byzantine Empire did have a Drinking Water Supply System present.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System was present in the Byzantine Empire III between 1073 and 1204 CE. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with Byzantine history, but I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Byzantine Empire, which is also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, existed from around 330 CE until its fall in 1453 CE. However, the specific polity referred to here, Byzantine Empire III, seems to be a smaller or perhaps a later part of the empire's history, maybe corresponding to the later periods when it was weaker.

The time frame given is from 1073 CE to 1204 CE. Wait, I think that this range falls into the Justinianic era. The Justinianic Period was named after Emperor Justinian I, who reigned from 527–565 CE and then again later, maybe around this time. He's known for his efforts to restore and expand the Byzantine Empire.

I remember reading that under Justinian, the empire made significant improvements in infrastructure, including roads and drainage systems. The Hadrian's Wall was a notable construction during his reign, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to water supply systems.

Thinking about drinking water specifically, I know that many ancient city-states and empires had systems like water towers or reservoirs to provide potable water. For example, the Great Wall of China is mentioned in some contexts, but I don't think that applies here. Also, cities like Constantinople probably had extensive water systems for their populations.

Moreover, Justinian's efforts were part of a broader project to modernize and defend the empire against invaders like the Normans, who had taken control of parts of the Byzantine territories around 1073 when this period starts. So, maintaining infrastructure must have been crucial for defense as well as daily life.

However, the later periods of the Byzantine Empire saw declining resources and population. By 1204 CE, the empire was on its way to collapse under Norman dominance. If that's the case, perhaps the drinking water system would have been less developed or absent as resources became scarce. But I'm not sure if that trend is directly linked.

Wait, during Justinian's reign, he did implement several engineering projects aimed at improving living conditions and infrastructure. This likely included better drainage to prevent disease from standing water, which was important for health in urban areas. If the drinking water supply system refers to these kinds of structures or systems, then it might have been present.

But as the empire lost territory and population, maybe those systems weren't maintained on all fronts. However, since the question is about a polity, perhaps the Byzantine Empire III was one of several regions or kingdoms within the empire at that time. It's possible that some areas had better infrastructure than others, but overall, if the system was present during Justinian's reign and then declined later, maybe it wasn't always present throughout the entire period.

I'm also thinking about the resources needed to maintain such a system. If the population decreased after 1073, perhaps there were fewer incentives or resources to build and maintain elaborate drinking water systems in all regions. So by 1204 CE, when the empire was on its way to collapsing, it's possible that many of these systems were absent because they weren't needed as much.

But then again, some areas might have retained infrastructure even after decline due to their strategic importance or other factors. It's a bit unclear without more specific information about the polity in question.

Given all this, I'm leaning towards thinking that while such a system was present during Justinian's time (1073–approximately), by 1204 CE, it might have been absent due to the empire's decline. However, this is speculative because I don't have exact records of each polity within the empire at that time.
</think>

The presence of a Drinking Water Supply System in Byzantine Empire III between 1073 and 1204 CE can be analyzed through the lens of the Justinianic Period (527–565 CE), during which significant infrastructure improvements, including water systems, were implemented. However, as the empire declined after this period, resources for maintaining such systems likely decreased.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Hatti - Old Kingdom had a Drinking Water Supply System. From what I remember, the Hatti Empire was around between 1650 BCE and 1500 BCE in modern-day present-day Tunisia. They were known for their advanced city planning and administrative systems.

I think they built cities with Causeways like El Djem, which are still functional today. These cities had infrastructure like roads, water supply, and maybe even drainage systems. Since these cities were complex polities, it's likely that they had systems to manage resources sustainably. Water was probably a vital resource for daily life, agriculture, and industry.

I'm not exactly sure if they had specialized buildings for drinking water, but the presence of Causeways suggests a well-planned distribution system. They might have used canals or wells, which would be part of their infrastructure.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Lysimachus Kingdom had a Drinking Water Supply System based on my knowledge of their history. The time period is between 323 BCE and 281 BCE.

First, I remember that Lysimachus was an ancient Greek polity in Lydia, known for its rich culture and infrastructure. They were around during the Hellenistic period, which saw a lot of development in cities like Athens, Alexandria, and Sparta. These cities had elaborate systems for water supply because of their urbanization.

Lysimachus Kingdom existed from roughly 323 BCE to 281 BCE, so they were part of the Greek city-states that flourished under the Hellenistic era. Given that, it's likely they would have had a system similar to other Greek polities at the time. Many cities in that period had wells and communal buildings for water supply, like the famous Olympian Ara in Athens.

I'm trying to recall if there are any records or texts from Lysimachus about their water supply systems. I don't remember specific references, but considering their status as a well-established polity, it's probable they had such infrastructure. They might have used wells and constructed buildings for storing and distributing water, which was essential for both domestic use and public needs.

Also, during that time, there were advancements in engineering and urban planning. Lysimachus would likely invest in such systems to ensure a reliable water supply, especially if they had significant urban areas or dependencies on water for agriculture.

So putting it all together, the presence of specialized buildings and owned drinking water supply systems seems plausible. Therefore, I expect that a Drinking Water Supply System was present during the Lysimachus Kingdom period.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the Ottoman Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System in place during its time. The Ottoman Empire existed from 1402 CE to 1517 CE, right? Okay, so I'm looking at this period before and after that.

First, I should understand what a Drinking Water Supply System entails. From the question, it's defined as specialized buildings owned by the polity or the state, either through community ownership or state ownership. So, if a place had its own water system with buildings like reservoirs, purification plants, maybe even water towers, then we'd say 'present'. If not, then 'absent'.

Now, thinking about the Ottoman Empire's history and infrastructure during that time. The Ottomans were known for their extensive administrative systems, which included dividing the empire into beylik (local administrative units) under the shah or sultan. These beylik had significant autonomy and control over local governance.

Hygiene and water supply are essential for health, especially in urban areas where diseases like cholera could be prevalent. So, it's plausible that the Ottomans would have had systems to manage water supplies efficiently. They probably built reservoirs to draw water from rivers or wells, maybe even filtration systems to purify water.

Moreover, with their vast empire stretching across multiple regions, having a centralized water supply system would help in managing resources effectively during times of war or disaster. This organization would also aid in maintaining control over local populations and preventing areas from becoming depopulated due to lack of essentials.

I should consider any historical sources or documents that might mention the presence of such systems. From what I remember, the Ottomans did have systems for controlling water resources, including regulating water levels in reservoirs through dikes and channels. They also likely had systems for desalination in places with limited freshwater sources. These systems were crucial for maintaining population health and ensuring the reliability of their resources.

Additionally, the administrative structure would support such a system. The beylik system allowed for local oversight while maintaining centralized control, which is necessary for managing large-scale water distribution networks.

So putting it all together, I think the Ottoman Empire did have a Drinking Water Supply System in place during its history. They had both infrastructure and organizational systems to handle water supply efficiently.

The Ottoman Empire, existing from 1402 CE to 1517 CE, was known for its extensive administrative structure and focus on resource management.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Ottoman Empire had a drinking water supply system in place during its time between 1517 CE and 1683 CE. I know that the Ottoman Empire was quite extensive, covering a lot of land from Anatolia all the way down to modern-day countries like Albania and parts of the Middle East. They were known for their administrative systems, which were pretty organized.

First, I should think about how empires typically obtain water resources. Ancient empires often relied on natural sources like rivers or wells because they were big and spread out. The Ottomans had a vast empire, so they would have needed reliable water supplies across such a large area. Specialized buildings for drinking water might include reservoirs, treatment plants, distribution systems, and maybe even cities built to hold and distribute water.

I remember that in some empires, especially those with significant agricultural activities or urban centers, having a structured water supply system was essential. The Ottomans were known for their efficient governance, so they probably had systems in place. Cities like Istanbul come to mind; they are massive and would require reliable water sources to sustain the population.

Also, considering their control over trade routes and extensive network of towns and cities, it's likely that the Ottomans needed a centralized way to manage water resources. They might have had aqueducts or other infrastructure to ensure that every part of their empire had access to clean drinking water.

Additionally, historical records from that period suggest that the Ottoman Empire did invest in infrastructure for their cities. For example, they built walls around their capital to protect against incursions and improve security, which implies a high level of organization and resource management. If they protected their capital with walls, it's reasonable to assume they had similar structures or systems for water supplies.

Moreover, the Ottomans were known for their engineering capabilities, so having a system to manage water distribution would have required skilled labor and planning. They might have built reservoirs in highland areas to ensure consistent water supply during dry seasons and then used that water to irrigate agriculture or supply cities.

Another point is that many empires, including the Ottomans, had public health considerations. Having a reliable water supply system would not only sustain the population but also maintain public health by ensuring access to safe drinking water, which was crucial for preventing diseases and maintaining urban populations.

I should also consider the time period. The Ottomans were around from 1517 to 1683 CE, which includes both medieval and early modern times. During this period, many empires invested in infrastructure projects, so it's plausible that the Ottomans would have had such systems in place.

In summary, given their vast empire, efficient administrative structure, investment in infrastructure, engineering capabilities, and public health considerations, it seems highly likely that the Ottoman Empire did have a drinking water supply system during this period. They probably maintained this through specialized buildings like reservoirs, aqueducts, treatment facilities, etc., ensuring a reliable water source for their entire empire.

The concept of an Ottoman Empire III is not well-documented historically. The Ottomans were a significant political power from approximately 1300 to 1923 CE. During the period in question (1683–1839), the empire was already experiencing decline, marked by conflicts and internal instability. Given this context, it is unlikely that a specialized drinking water supply system would have been present.

The absence of such a system can be attributed to the challenges faced by the empire during its later years, including limited resources, logistical difficulties in maintaining a centralized water supply, and political instability which could have impeded infrastructure development.

The Anishinaabeg had been inhabited for a very long time before European contact, so they would have had established systems of resource management, including water supply.

I recall that large communities often built infrastructure like wells or reservoirs to ensure access to clean water, especially in regions prone to drought or unreliable natural water sources. Indigenous communities likely had knowledge and practices that ensured water availability for their people, which was crucial for agriculture, drinking, and health.

However, during European colonization, there might have been disruptions to these systems as settlers took land from the indigenous peoples without permission. This could have led to changes in how resources were managed. But even with colonizers taking over some lands, the Haudenosaunee continued their way of life, so they probably maintained their own infrastructure.

I also need to consider if any historical sources or documents mention the presence of a drinking water supply system during this period. Without specific records, it's hard to say definitively, but given their history and the importance of water for survival, it's reasonable to expect that such a system existed.

Additionally, looking at similar indigenous communities in North America, many did have elaborate systems for water supply, especially in regions with challenging geography. The Haudenosaunee, being in an area that likely had seasonal fluctuations in water sources (like rivers and lakes), would need reliable methods to ensure consistent access.

So putting it all together, while European colonization might have caused some changes or challenges, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was a large, long-standing community with established practices. They were likely self-sufficient in water supply even during the early colonial period.

The Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an indigenous Anishinaabeg community in present-day Ontario, Canada, likely had a drinking water supply system in place between 1566 CE and 1713 CE. As an ancient and long-standing community, they would have developed robust infrastructure to manage their resources, including water. Despite European colonization, which may have disrupted some systems, the Haudenosaunee maintained their self-sufficient ways of life with reliable water management practices.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether there was a Drinking Water Supply System (DWS) in the Haudenosaunee Confederacy between 1714 CE and 1848 CE. First, I should understand what exactly this system entails. According to the question, it's about specialized buildings owned by the polity or communities within them for providing drinking water. So if a polity had such systems, it would be present; otherwise, absent.

I know that Haudenosaunee refers to the Iroquois people's political organization, which was one of the Lgonkéwa confederacies in North America. The Late period is from 1714 to 1848 CE. This includes parts of what are now New York and Ontario provinces.

I need to recall if there were any significant water systems established by the Iroquois during this time. From what I remember, the Haudenosaunee had a centralized water system for their administration. They used communal wells for potable water in their cities like Syracuse (now Rochester), Mohonk, and Cornwall (Ottawa). These were important for drinking, cooking, and religious purposes.

The Iroquois were known for managing water resources efficiently as part of their sodawhore system, which included controlling water supplies to maintain control over neighboring communities. This system was integral to their governance and survival, especially during conflicts with European settlers or Native American tribes.

Considering the time frame given (1714-1848), this period includes both the end of the Iroquois dominance in upstate New York and the start of British colonization in Canada. However, even after the Haudenosaunee disintegrated around 1800s, their cities continued to function. The water systems were likely maintained by whoever took over those areas once the polity was no longer present.

So, during the Late period, whether the system was present would depend on who held control of those regions. If a subsequent colonial power or another indigenous group had control, they might have managed their own water supply. But if the Iroquois themselves were managing it, then yes, there would be a DWS.

Given that, and considering the definition provided, which includes ownership by the community or state (so even if it's the polity, but in this case, after disintegration, it might have been absorbed into other systems), I think the presence of such a system is expected. Even though the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was dissolved around 1805, their cities continued to use communal water supplies well beyond that.

Therefore, during the Late period, there would still be some form of Drinking Water Supply System present in those areas that were under their jurisdiction or control.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Samanid Empire had a Drinking Water Supply System. I'm not too familiar with their history, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, who was the Samanid Empire? From what I remember, it's an ancient Persian empire that existed from around 819 CE to 999 CE. The Sasanians were a prominent power before the Persians, so maybe the Samanids inherited some of their systems. They were known for expanding their territory and integrating various cultures.

I think about what kind of infrastructure a polity would need during that time. Ancient empires often built cities with specialized buildings, like water supply systems. These might have included reservoirs, canals, or filtration systems to ensure access to safe drinking water.

Considering the time period, 9th to 10th century CE, it's likely that they had some form of infrastructure management since that was a common need for cities and growing populations. However, I'm not sure if they went as far as having a specialized building dedicated solely to drinking water or if they just used simpler solutions like elevated jars.

Also, the Samanid Empire probably interacted with local communities and other regions. They might have incorporated existing water sources rather than starting from scratch. So maybe their system was present but perhaps not as elaborate as in later periods.

I'm trying to recall if I've heard anything specific about their water supply systems. I don't remember any prominent details, which might suggest that it wasn't a major focus of their administration. Alternatively, they might have been more focused on military infrastructure and less on everyday necessities like drinking water.

Another angle is the political structure. If the Samanid Empire was a centralized polity, they might have had a system in place to manage resources efficiently. Specialized buildings for water supply could indicate a well-organized society with attention to public welfare, which would fit an empire's needs.

But without specific records or historical texts mentioning their drinking water supply systems, it's hard to be certain. It's possible that they did have such a system but didn't leave detailed records, or maybe it wasn't as advanced as other aspects of their governance.

In summary, based on what I know about the Samanid Empire and typical needs of ancient polities during that era, I would expect them to have had some form of Drinking Water Supply System. They likely integrated basic infrastructure to support their growing population and administration.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a Drinking Water Supply System existed in Sogdiana during its city-states period from 604 CE to 711 CE. First off, I need to understand what exactly the question is asking. A Drinking Water Supply System here refers to specialized buildings that are either owned by the polity itself or the community as part of their water supply infrastructure.

Now, considering Sogdiana, it was an independent city-state from around 450 CE until its conquest in 622 CE by the Umayyads. The period we're looking at is after that conquest and before another empire, probably the Byzantines, took over in 711 CE.

I remember reading that Sogdiana had a complex system of irrigation canals, especially around Lake Sargsyan (which later became lakeith). These were used for agriculture. Since water was crucial for farming, it makes sense that they would have systems to manage and distribute it effectively. However, these were more about irrigation than drinking water.

I also recall that during the city-states period, Sogdiana's economy relied heavily on trade, both in antiquity and later under the Abbasid Caliphate. Their cities were centers of activity where people exchanged goods and ideas. For such a bustling population, having a reliable water supply would have been essential for daily life, not just for agriculture but also for hygiene and urban functions.

Under the Umayyads, after their conquest, Sogdiana was ruled by the Buwayhids, who were an Arab dynasty. I'm not sure if they had similar infrastructure to the earlier rulers. Maybe they relied more on local sources or trade rather than a centralized water supply system. However, since the city-states period was after their rule, we need to look at what the Abbasid Caliphate did.

Under the Abbasids, there was significant investment in infrastructure, including roads and canals. They also built reservoirs for drinking water, which suggests that maintaining a reliable water supply was part of their planning. If Sogdiana continued under similar policies after the Umayyads were gone, it might have had such systems.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if they inherited these systems or adapted them to their own needs. Also, considering the transition from one empire to another, there might have been some disruption in infrastructure. The Battle of Siffina in 650 CE was a major event under the Abbasids, which could have affected the stability of any existing systems.

Moreover, the city-states period included periods of autonomy and perhaps some internal instability or conflict that might have impacted the maintenance of such systems. If there were external threats, like invasions, that could have led to the destruction or neglect of infrastructure.

On the other hand, if Sogdiana's economy remained robust with trade networks, they might have needed a reliable water supply to sustain their population and commerce. Perhaps they built public buildings for storing and distributing water, which would fit the definition of a Drinking Water Supply System.

I'm also thinking about the social structure during this period. If it was more urbanized, having dedicated facilities for drinking water would make sense to ensure hygiene standards. Urban areas need clean water sources, especially with the increasing population density.

But I'm not certain if the Abbasids specifically provided funds or support for such systems in Sogdiana after their rule ended. It might have been more of a centralized effort rather than something the city-states themselves initiated.

In conclusion, considering the reliance on agriculture and trade, the need for clean water sources, and the possible continuation of infrastructure under subsequent empires, I would lean towards expecting that a Drinking Water Supply System was present in Sogdiana during this period. However, without concrete evidence from that specific time, it's a bit speculative.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a drinking water supply system existed in Yemen during the Qasimid Dynasty, which was from 1637 CE to 1805 CE. I'm not super familiar with Yemen's history, but I know that Yemen has had several civilizations and political periods. The Qasimids were one of them.

First, I should recall what a drinking water supply system entails. It includes specialized buildings like wells, maybe reservoirs, pipes, or filtration systems that the polity owns. So it's not just about access to water but also how it's provided centrally.

I remember that many ancient civilizations had some form of water management systems. For example, the Greeks and Romans built irrigation systems, and later empires like the Ottomans in the 16th-19th centuries had well-developed infrastructure including for drinking water. The Ottomans were known for their extensive network of water supply, especially after moving their capital to Istanbul.

The Qasimids are a relatively recent dynasty compared to other Yemeni periods. They came after the Banu Miah and were followed by the Sadiyya dynasty until 1805 when they lost power to the Sadiyya. Given that the Ottomans had such systems, maybe Yemen under the Qasimids would have similar infrastructure.

Also, Yemen is an arid country, so having a reliable water supply system would be crucial for agriculture and daily life. The ability to store water in reservoirs or manage the flow through wells could prevent shortages. The Qasimid rulers might have inherited some systems from previous rulers, especially if resources were already being managed.

I'm not sure about specific records, but considering Yemen's location and historical context, it's plausible that they had a system. Maybe there are references in historical texts or inscriptions from the 17th to early 19th centuries when the Qasimids were in power. Also, empires typically invest in infrastructure for survival, so it's likely they would have such a system.

Wait, but did the Ottomans necessarily transfer their systems to Yemen? Maybe not directly, as Yemen had its own unique challenges. Perhaps the Qasimids adapted existing systems or built new ones tailored to their needs. There might be some local infrastructure that evolved over time.

I should also consider any natural resources in Yemen. The Red Sea coast has saltwater, which can be used after evaporation. Maybe the Qasimids utilized this for drinking water supply, but I'm not sure if that counts as a specialized building system. That could fall under having a system without the physical infrastructure of buildings.

Alternatively, maybe they didn't have such systems because of limited resources or lack of investment in infrastructure during their reign. But considering the time period and Yemen's strategic location for trade and agriculture, it seems more likely that they would have some form of water supply system, even if it was simple.

I think I'm leaning towards present because aridity requires reliable water sources, and rulers often invest in such systems to sustain their population and economy. So, I expect the Drinking Water Supply System to be present during the Qasimids.
